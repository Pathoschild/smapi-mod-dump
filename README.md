**This repository is obsolete.**

It previously contained every mod in the [SMAPI compatibility list](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:SMAPI_compatibility),
including both compiled and source code versions, to allow searching mod code and performing analyses.

Unfortunately, maintaining it became unsustainable with the increasing popularity of Stardew Valley mods.

Instead, you can either:
1. [Run the scripts to create a more automated dump](https://github.com/Pathoschild/StardewScripts) (requires special
   permissions from mod sites to access private APIs).
2. Join [#making-mods-general on the Stardew Valley Discord](https://smapi.io/community#Discord) (free) or
   [my Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/pathoschild) (paid) for monthly updates, including both analyses/stats and a
   link to download the full mod dump.
