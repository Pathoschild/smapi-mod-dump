-If you don't see the config.json file, start the game with this mod installed.

If you want to deactivate the balanced mode so the junimos appear right way, enter de config and change "balancedMode" to false. You can change the price or select to no use resources (stone, starfruit and fiber) for the construction of th shrine as well. 

Instructions for custom Greenhouse maps:
-If you don't see the config file, start the game with this mod installed.
-Find a way to view tile coordinates inside your Greenhouse (I use the DebugMode mod).
-Find a good place for the chest to be and change "chestX" and "chestY" from de config file to your new coordinates.
-Find the centre of your farming area and change "junimoX" and "junimoY" from the config file to the centre coordinates.
-Count the distance in tiles from the centre to the farthest edge of the farming area and change "radius" from the config file to the distance plus one.
