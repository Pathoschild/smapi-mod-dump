"Mining with Explosives" by Nishtra

Fix default game's behaviour when using bombs anywhere except mines wouldn't generate loot.



Installation
0. Install the latest version of SMAPI
1. Unpack the downloaded zip file and place it's contents into the Mods folder
2. Tweak the configs to your liking. If there is no config file or you want to reset all settings to default, delete existing config file and the next time you load the game a new config will be created.
3. Play the game.  
  


Config settings:
  > "destroyArtifactSpots": default TRUE - explosions destroy artifact spots without giving you any loot. Set to FALSE to have blown up artifact spots produce artifact (or just clay. Mostly clay).
  > "verbose": default FALSE. Set to TRUE if you want messages about exploded items be logged to console.



Requires SMAPI!
