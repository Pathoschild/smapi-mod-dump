SIV'S MARRIAGE MOD

Hello! Thank you for downloading this mod for Stardew Valley.

This is Siv's Marriage Mod, which makes every adult, single NPC in the game romance-able and
marriage-able like the original 10 marriage candidates. This mod DOES NOT include Shane or Emily.
This mod includes romance and marriage for the following eight characters:

Clint
Gus
Lewis
Linus
Marnie
Pam
Sandy
Willy
Wizard

This will allow you to give them the Bouquet, the Mermaid's Pendant, marry them, dance with them
at the Flower Dance (except in Sandy's case), and have children with them.

WARNING: I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU BACK UP YOUR ENTIRE "CONTENT" FOLDER AND YOUR "SAVES" FOLDER
(IN APPDATA) BEFORE INSTALLING THIS MOD. I (SIV) AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY UNEXPECTED OUTCOMES
\OF THIS MOD. IF YOU FIND ANY ERRORS THATARE NOT MENTIONED IN THIS README.TXT OR IN THE MOD POST
ON THE CHUCKLEFISH FORUMS, PLEASE LET ME KNOW BY POSTING IN THAT THREAD, ON NEXUSMODS, OR EMAILING
ME AT TORILEBLANC@LIVE.COM.

***HOW TO INSTALL***
To install this mod, simply COPY AND PASTE the "Content" folder from the .zip file to
Steam\steamapps\common\Stardew Valley, and select yes to replace the files.

***HOW TO INSTALL WORKING SPOUSE ROOMS***
Version 1.1.0 now comes with WORKING SPOUSE ROOMS, but it uses SMAPI 0.40.0. Because of this,
the spouse rooms feature is optional, but I definitely recommend installing it because they're
cool and I worked really hard on this feature. To install the Spouse Rooms feature, you must
first install Stardew Modding API (SMAPI). You can find the download here:

https://github.com/ClxS/SMAPI/releases/tag/0.40.0

Then, simply drag the SivsSpouseRooms folder into the Mods folder that came with the SMAPI installation.

***HOW TO INSTALL VISUAL UPDATES***
Each character in my mod comes with an OPTIONAL visual update. Open the "Visual Update" folder,
then the "Before & After" folder to see the differences. Go back to the "Visual Update" folder.
If you want to install ALL 9 OF THE VISUAL UPDATES, simply COPY the "Characters" and "Portraits"
folders from here and PASTE them into Steam\steamapps\common\Stardew Valley\Content, and select
yes to replace the files.

!!!TO INSTALL INDIVIDUAL VISUAL UPDATES!!!
If you want the visual updates for SOME but not ALL of the 9 characters, go to the "Visual Update"
folder, then open "Characters". COPY the .XNB files for the characters you want the new version of,
then PASTE those .XNB files into Steam\steamapps\common\Stardew Valley\Content\Characters.
THEN, go to back to the "Visual Update" folder and open "Portraits". COPY the .XNB files for the
characters you want the new version of (the same characters as above), then PASTE those .XNB files into
Steam\steamapps\common\Stardew Valley\Portraits, and select yes to replace the files. If you do not
install BOTH files for a character, it may cause errors.

&&&TO REMOVE CHARACTERS FROM THIS MOD&&&
Unfortunately, it is not simple to remove individual characters from this mod. If you would like to
do so, you must unpack this mod's XNB files (you can find instructions for this on the Chucklefish
forums), open the NPCDispositions.yaml file, find the line of the character you want to remove,
and change the "datable" element to "not-datable". Then you must repack the .yaml into .xnb and put
it into Steam\steamapps\common\Stardew Valley\Content\Data, then select yes to replace the file.
If you need further instruction on this process, feel free to contact me or seek help elsewhere.
