Prices update at the start of the day based on current supply and how much other farmers are producing of a given item.^^2. Just like you, other farmers change what they produce every season. This means the daily change of supply is new each season.^^3. At the end of the year, supply resets across the board as we normalize available resources.^^Thank you for your service, and we look forward to a long and prosperous relationship.^^^-- Ferngill Economic Board",
