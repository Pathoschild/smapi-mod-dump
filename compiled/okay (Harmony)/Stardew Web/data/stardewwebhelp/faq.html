            <b>Can I access the web page from another PC?</b> - Yes<br />
            To view the web site on another machine there are 3 steps:
            <ol style="font-family:'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">
                <li>
                    Change the 'Server Address' parameter to "http://+:8080/" in the Config view of the mod or in the config.json file in the mod's directory.  The game will have to be re-started for the change to take effect.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Open a command window, as administrator, and run the following command:
                    <br /><br />
                    netsh http add urlacl url=http://+:8080/ user=Everyone
                    <br /><br />
                    This command allows the mod to use the 8080 port, without having to run as administrator.  The alternative to this command is run stardew as administrator, which is not a good way to run.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Run windows defender firewall and add a program exception for stardewmoddingapi.
                    (The rule is most likely already there.)
                </li>
            </ol>
            <br />
            You will now be able to view the mod from any machine on your local network.
            <br />

            <b>DO NOT PORT FORWARD TO THIS ADDRESS</b>.<br /><br />This mod is not hardened to be exposed to the nasty internet.
        </li>
    </ul>
