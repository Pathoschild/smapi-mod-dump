Recent studies showed that it's safe and works fine. ^   Initially we thought that the EMF from the shard would interact negatively with the crystalarium, and it could be harmful to people near it. But that's not the case, it just make it take a lot more time for the shard to be cloned. ^   We are also pleased to announce that with 'external help', you can tune the crystalarium to copy a variety of objects, not just gems and minerals. Its even possible to change current copy time of minerals and gems.^^   -Ferngill Technology Association",
