This folder contains optional compatibility files.
These files must be installed manually, by overwriting the corresponding files in the third-party mod.

- STARDEW VALLEY EXPANDED: If playing with the CMBT module, then replace SVE's FTM folder with the included one. This will prevent SVE from spawning Mythic weapons as forage in the Forest and the Crimson Badlands.
- ARCHERY STARTER PACK: If playing with the CMBT module, then I recommend overwriting its Starter Pack with the included files. It will rebalance the Starter Pack bows and arrows to fit with the theme of this mod, and also add additional gemstone arrows to complete the set.
- CJB CHEATS MENU: If playing with PROFS module then you may also wish to instal the **Localization files for CJB Cheats Menu** so that the Skills cheat menu displays the professions added by this mod, instead of the vanilla ones.
- MOON MISADVENTURES + GRANDPA'S TOOLS: Replace Moon's tools textures with those inside this folder to get Radioactive and Mythicite upgrades compatible with Grandpa's Tools.
