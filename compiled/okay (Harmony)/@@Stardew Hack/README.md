# Stardew Hack

## Description
This is a library/core mod, containing bits of code that all my other mods use. It has some functions to make small bytecode changes to Stardew Valley in a way that is somewhat update proof, but also makes sure it reliably breaks in cases where it isn't. My other mods contain descriptions of byte code changes and passes those to StardewHack to apply them. Without any of my other mods installed, StardewHack won't do much. 

While I could just package a copy of this core mod with all my other mods, that allows people to have mixed versions, which cause really weird bugs. Having StardewHack as a separate mod ensures there's only one copy and thus no version issues.

## Used by
This library is used by the following mods:

* [Always Scroll Map](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2733):                   Makes the map scroll past the edge of the map.
* [Bigger Backpack](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1845):                     Adds an additional upgrade to the backpack for 48 slots.
* [Fix Animal Tool Animations](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/3215):          When using the shears or milk pail, the animation no longer plays when no animal is nearby.

## FAQ
**Do the mods also work on Android?** With the exception of Bigger Backpack and Wear More Rings, the mods also work on Android. 

**Does mod *x* work on the latest version of Stardew Valley?** Please check the SMAPI [mod compatibility](https://smapi.io/mods) page for up-to-date information. The mods that broke in 1.5 have been updated. If there's no download for 1.5, then the download for 1.4 will also work on 1.5.

## Known bugs
Please report bugs on [GitHub](https://github.com/bcmpinc/StardewHack/issues).
* StardewHack has been built on Linux and therefore needs rewriting to work on Windows. SMAPI does this automatically, however if during startup Stardew Valley hangs on `Loading StardewHack.dll (rewritten in memory)...`, this is probably due to your virus scanner preventing SMAPI from doing so.
