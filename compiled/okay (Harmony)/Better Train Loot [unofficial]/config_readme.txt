## Configuration Setting
### Overview of Config json File
Once this mod is installed and been started at least once, you can adjust some settings.  
If you don't have a config.json file, then the config file will be created when you first run Stardew Valley with this mod.
You should not need to adjust the configuration settings but if you do, here are what the setting are inside the config.json file:

#### enableMod
Sets the mod as enabled or disabled.  Normally should be set to true unless you are having issues and want to test something without removing the mod.  
- Default Value: true 

#### useCustomTrainTreasure
Uses the custom treasure list.  If set to false, then the base game item list is used.  
- Default Value: true 

#### enableNoLimitTreasurePerTrain
Maximum treasure from each train.  The amount is still random but there is not limited on the amount.
- Default Value: false 

#### showTrainIsComingMessage
