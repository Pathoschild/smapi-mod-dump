# Smart Building release notes
## 1.8.0
#### Fixes
* 1.6 compatibility.
## 1.7.12
Fixed some GMCM naming issues that made things look terrible.
## 1.7.11
Fixed a problem placing DengDeng Monogatari's chest opener.
## 1.7.10
New creative mode feature!
## 1.7.8
Hopefully fully fixed the item stowing issue, and added a workaround to recover from the previous glitched state. Added a PR from atravita adding support for their upcoming mod.
## 1.7.7
Fixes a fairly long-standing problem with item stowing, and the initial version of an object counting command.
## 1.7.4
Adds integration for Tap Giant Crops, and Toolbar Icons!
## 1.7.3
Small bugfix!
## 1.7.2
Added a Spanish translation courtesy of sergiomadd. Thank you very much!
## 1.7.1
Added support for aedenthorn's wonderful Prismatic Fire mod. Now you can insert its supported gems into torches using the insertion tool from a distance. Also added some safety compatibility for Better Chests, and hotkeys for confirming and cancelling the build.
## 1.7.0
There's a UI, and significantly fewer essential hotkeys.
## 1.6.0
Now you can draw a filled rectangle using the keybind (which is configurable, of course), place torches on fences as if you were drawing normally, and replace fences with gates without needing to manually destroy the fence first.
## 1.5.1
Now there's a "more lax object placement" setting, meaning you can place objects (fences, sprinklers, etc.) in more, stranger places than vanilla would typically let you.
## 1.5.0
Added support for all More Fertilizers fertilisers (thanks for that, Atravita!), as well as translation support, and Chinese translation thanks to Becks723.
## 1.4.0
Fixed a few bugs, and changed item pickup behaviour.
## 1.3.3
Fixed the bug with scaling the build queue UI.
## 1.3.2
Now you can insert items into machines using Smart Building! Also fixed some modded seeds from not working correctly.
## 1.2.0
Added the ability to place furniture in typically impossible places, including beds.
## 1.1.1
Hotfix release for the bug introduced with planting trees and fruit trees in 1.1.0.
## 1.1.0
Added the ability to remotely pick up objects and flooring. Fences will only be returned to your inventory if they're still undamaged, exactly as in vanilla.
## 1.0.8
Now you can enable some optional toggles to allow you to place floors in typically impossible places, and replace fences and floors in-place.
## 1.0.7
Fixed a bug with fertilizing crops, where it would be possible to lose fertilizer due to crops being too old to be fertilized.
## 1.0.6
Added a build queue, so you can see exactly which items you have queued, and how many of each. This can be disabled in the settings.
## 1.0.5
Added tree tapper support, along with a toggle to disable it if you find it too cheaty.
## 1.0.4
Added toggles to disable some slightly cheaty building options, such as crops, tree fertilisers, etc.
## 1.0.3
I removed a debug keybind I accidentally left in. Oops!
## 1.0.2
Fixed all bugs reported so far (placing crops, and placing bombs outside of build mode).
## 1.0.1
I fixed my manifest boo-boo.
## 1.0.0
The mod exists!
