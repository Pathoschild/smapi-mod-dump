	"AnimalContest.Dialog.MaruAct.Lewis.FirstTime3": "The invitation also say Stardew Valley ANIMAL Contest. So you know it isn't for robot pets.#$b#Anyway, how would I evaluate it? Can it do tricks?",
	"AnimalContest.Dialog.MaruAct.Maru.FirstTime3": "I'm still working on tricks, but it already eats treats. It likes oil, grease and batteries.$h",

	"AnimalContest.Dialog.ShaneAct.Lewis.FirstTime3": "Now let's see if you're as good at preparing hens for the contest as you are at mixing their colors.",
	"AnimalContest.Dialog.ShaneAct.Lewis.FirstTime4": "You did great for a first timer, but you're still missing a thing or two.",
	"AnimalContest.Dialog.ShaneAct.Shane.FirstTime3": "This hen was one of the first to have the blue color. So I know it's not as young as required.#$b#It also had to have a specific diet. So I couldn't give it as many treats as I wanted.",
	"AnimalContest.Dialog.ShaneAct.Lewis.FirstTime5": "Oh, I see Marnie has thought you well. I'm sure you'll do better next time then.",
	"AnimalContest.Dialog.ShaneAct.Lewis.OtherTimes1": "Great to see you at the contest again, Shane.",

	"AnimalContest.Dialog.EmilyAct.Emily.FirstTime2": "Because he lives with me and can't fly. But once I told him about the contest he wanted to come.",
	"AnimalContest.Dialog.EmilyAct.Lewis.FirstTime3": "Well, I never saw a case like this. But there's no rule against it.#$b#Does it know any tricks?",
	"AnimalContest.Dialog.EmilyAct.Emily.FirstTime3": "Why don't you ask him yourself?",
	"AnimalContest.Dialog.EmilyAct.Lewis.FirstTime4": "Er... do you know any tricks?",
	"AnimalContest.Dialog.EmilyAct.Lewis.FirstTime5": "Nice, you answered me, any more tricks?$h",
	"AnimalContest.Dialog.EmilyAct.Emily.FirstTime4": "It's my fault, I should have talked to him how the contest work, so he could prepare better.$s",

	"AnimalContest.Dialog.EmilyAct.Lewis.OtherTimes3": "That was wonderful.$h#$b#I know it isn't your pet, but I'll evaluate it as such since you brought it, okay Emily?",
	"AnimalContest.Dialog.EmilyAct.Emily.OtherTimes3": "That's fine, we know the rules.",
