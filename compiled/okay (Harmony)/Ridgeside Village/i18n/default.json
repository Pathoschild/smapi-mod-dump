Whenever we tried to take down the wall, it would grow back stronger. One may think that my wife and I would hold a grudge against the higher power that trapped us. But no, we didn't mind.^There must be a reason why nature trapped us, and we like to think that we were saved from that ominous mist. And for that, we thank Yoba for giving us the oppurtunity to live out the rest of our lives in peace.^It has been years and we are happy. One day, this land that was once full of crops my wife and I cherished like children, will all be gone.^And when that day comes, I know my wife and I would have already went back to Yoba's arms and the walls might have come down.^^To whoever's reading this, this land is yours to take.^All I ask is you give it love as we did before.^May Yoba bless you.^^- R",
