    "CropTransplant.Letter":"Dear @,^^Call me a silly old fool... but when I gave you the garden pot, I forgot to tell you a great tip about it. Besides planting, you can also use the pot to transplant crops. Pretty handy, don't you think?^^I always call Alex to help me though, as it take quite some energy to lift a crop out of the ground. But be careful dear, once you lift the crop, you have to plant it again or put the pot down before doing other things, or you might destroy the crop.^   I hope you like this tip, take care.^   -Evelyn",
