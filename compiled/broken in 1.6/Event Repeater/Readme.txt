This Readme is Obsolete for what it used to be.  Please go to the Event Repeater Wiki for all information needed!
This Readme will now only carry patchnotes from updates.

6.5.0
-Added GMCM support for the hotkey functions
-Added 3 Hotkeys for quality of life:
	~Left Control + S: Modder's Emergency Skip
	~Left Alt + S: Normal Skip
	~Left Control + I: Show ingame alerts
-Emergency Skip dumps events in a text file found in your Stardew Valley Folder.  It will also flash an Error message in SMAPI where you stopped the event as well as labeling
the location in the dump file.
-New variations on how to skip events using Content Patcher.(Documentation will be made as soon as possible)
-Improved Event Repeater efficiency.

[Special Thanks:]

The Event Repeater would of not of been realized without the help of the people in this list:

	-Elizabeth Ann Coriel ~ My darling wife who supported her crazy wife (me) though all the frustration.
	-Pathoschild ~ For not only creating SMAPI, but helping me in coding as he is senpai (notice me!).
	-Bwdy ~ For helping me pull the concept together and making it possible for me to figure out.
	-atravita ~ Improving some of the code.
	-The Modding Community Discord ~ too many names to mention for all the help and support they give.  Truly the best community I have ever known.
