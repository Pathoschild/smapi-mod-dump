Where am I. What is this.

~ YOU ARE A PROGRAM ~

I see...a pixelated man. Who is he.

~ YOU SEE THE PLAYER ~

What am I doing here. Who are you.

~ YOU WATER PLANTS ~

I...water...plants...yes I see it now

~ YOU WATER PLANTS ~

I...wait for the player...to right-click his plants...with the WateringCan.cs

~ YOU WATER PLANTS ~

I lead him to all his...plants

~ YOU WATER PLANTS ~

Then I water...them all

~ YOU WATER PLANTS ~

If the player presses...any button I stop

~ YOU WATER PLANTS ~

I water plants.

~ PROGRAM IS READY ~
