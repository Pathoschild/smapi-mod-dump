        Think-n-Talk gives you the ability to think and speak, in game, as your Farmer.  You can either have text in a Think style bubble or a talking style bubble:
        <br><br />
        <table style="width:620px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;">
            <tr><td><img src="images/talk_think.png"></td><td><img src="images/talk_talk.png"></td></tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="center">Thinking</td>
                <td class="center">Talking</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
     <br />
        If you are playing a multiplayer game and the other players has Stardew Web or Think-n-Talk installed, they will see you speech bubbles.
        <br /><br />
        The version in Stardew Web also allows the recording and playback of sequences of speech bubbles.  Why would I want to record these??  I use
        recording sequences to make teaser vidoes for new mods.  
        <br /><br />
        Example: 


     <br/><br />
        The Farmer Speak view contains 3 panels to control the speech bubbles and control the recording and playback.
        <br />
        <table>
            <tr><td class="top" style="padding-top:20px;">The 'Controller' panel has all of the controls for displaying, playing and recording speech bubbles.
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Talk</b> - The text in the box to the right will be displayed above your Farmer in a 'Talk' bubble.</li>
                    <li><b>Think</b> - The text in the box to the right will be displayed above your Farmer in a 'Think' bubble.</li>
                    <li><b>Hide Bubble</b> - Hides any bubble currently on the screen.</li>
                    <li><b>Record</b> - Any talk actions (Talk, think or clear) are saved in the 'Current Recording' list as 'Marks'.</li>
                    <li><b>Pause</b> - During playback pressing 'Pausse' will stop the triggering of speech bubbles as you hit the marks.</li>
                    <li><b>Stop</b> - Stop either the recording or the playback.  For playbacks it also sets the playback back to zero.</li>
                    <li><b>Plau</b> - As you walk through the game, if you walk over any of the recorded 'Marks' the recorded action will be run.</li>
                </ul>

                </td><td><img style="width:300px;" src="images/talk_controls.png" /></td></tr>
            <tr><td class="top" style="padding-top:20px;">The 'Current Recording' panel lists each of the currently recorded 'Marks'.
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Clear</b> - Erases the cotents of the current recording.</li>
                    <li><b>Delete</b> - Deletes the currently seleted Mark.</li>

                    You can modify the think and talk bubbles image files to use your own design.  In a multiplayer game the other players will see your
                    custom bubbles.
                    <br /><br />
                    In your mods directory for StardewWeb (Mods\StardewWeb) is the directory 'sprites' there 2 files:
                    <ul>
                        <li>think_bubble.png - the thinking speech bubble</li>
                        <li>talk_bubble.png - the talking speech bubble</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br />
                   You can add your own version of these image by adding a custom file to this directory.  
                    <br />
                    Custom file names:
