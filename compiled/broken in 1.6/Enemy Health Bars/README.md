## Instructions

This mod places health bars over enemies heads, but it takes in account your combat experience, and how well you know that enemy.

You can't see health bars on hidden enemies, and the amount of information available changes based on the combat level and how much of that enemy was killed.

This mod supports configuration files! If you edit the config.json file, you can choose a colour scheme, currently there are only two availble, suggestions are welcome.

Colour scheme 0 (default): Full health enemies show green, low health red.
Colour scheme 1 (Inverted): Full health enemies show red, low health enemies show green.
