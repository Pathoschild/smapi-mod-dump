====================================
Stardew Druid - 1.6 Ready
====================================

40+ quests, 25+ abilities, 5 unique NPCs, 10 custom locations, 30+ collectables, 2500+ lines of dialogue and lore, Stardew Druid is a unique kind of expansion created to satisfy a desire for adventure.

This mod provides an alternative to early tool-based gameplay in the form of five schools of magic, which incorporate motifs and themes inspired by the Druids of antiquity!

The expansive questline starts with a custom NPC, the Effigy, located in the Farmcave, who will initially offer a new lesson or quest each day. The mod includes over ten epic boss battles to test your skills, with a range of configuration options to suit your playstyle. There are 21 lessons in total 

Your journey is recorded in the Stardew Druid journal, a custom journal menu that provides all the instruction and lore you could ask for. 

The mod works primarily though the use of the 'rite button', which is by default configured to keyboard V, mouse button 4, mouse button 5 and controller LeftShoulder.

For any mod support, discussion or feedback we recommend you join us on discord as opposed to posting on Nexus. Depending on timezones you might be able to get a response in under a minute!

-----------------------------------------
1. Rite of the Weald
-----------------------------------------
Weald is an old fashioned name for a woodland area, where ancient druids would perform ceremonies honouring the kings of Oak and Holly. This rite is about rewilding the empty spaces of the Valley and drawing on the life essence of the Earth.

Draw out the hidden bounty of the valley, add trees and grass to barren spaces, enhance the growth rate of crops, explode weeds, twigs, ore veins and trigger rock falls in the mines.

-----------------------------------------
2. Rite of the Mists
-----------------------------------------
The isle of mists is an important place in medieval sagas, and the residence of the Lady Beyond the Shore. This rite is about being a commanding presence with awesome displays of power and lots of lightning bolts.

Extract power from totem shrines, target scarecrows, rods and campfires for special functions, create high-yield fishing spots, and smite any obstacle in your way. 

-----------------------------------------
3. Rite of the Stars 
-----------------------------------------
Celestial bodies and formations were an important device of storytelling and calendar traditions. That's all very wonderful and this rite is about calling down little stars as fireballs.

Call a meteor shower and rain down fire from the sky with reckless abandon. Call an even bigger comet down when used in conjunction with abilities learned later.

-----------------------------------------
4. Rite of the Fates
-----------------------------------------
The fates are mentioned in many traditions of cultures that were adjacent to or inspired by the Fates of Greek mythology, and are the etymological root for faeries, fae and the like. This rite is about chance and destiny intertwined to produce random effects.

Meddle with the powers of the fates and to warp travel, dazzle enemies and villagers, power machines with essence and create anomalies in reality itself. 

-----------------------------------------
5. Rite of the Ether
----------------------------------------
The fifth element, ether, which inspires a lot of alchemical traditions, is considered to incorporate both the spiritual/divine and the material. The traditional progenitors and agents of this element were... Dragons.

Transform into a Dragon!

-----------------------------------------
+ Additional Features
-----------------------------------------
Gently caress your farm animals and neighbours with magic for soft friendship points each day.
Prove yourself in new, unique challenges that test your ability with each rite.
Encounter customised creatures with enhanced stats, cosmetics and behaviour.

CASTING RITES

Any of the main line of vanilla tools (Pickaxe, Axe, Hoe, WateringCan etc) or any Melee Weapon (Including Scythe) must be selected in toolbar to perform a rite (cast). This restriction can be changed with the Slot Attune and Slot Freedom configuration options.

An attuned weapon will be provided for every rite learnt.

-----------------------------------------
CONFIG FILE
-----------------------------------------
GMCM has been integrated

Rite Buttons "riteButtons" is a list of keybinds set to MouseX1, MouseX2, Keyboard.V and LeftShoulder
Action Buttons "actionButtons" is a list of keybinds set to MouseLeft, ControllerX and Keyboard.C
Special Buttons "specialButtons" is a list of keybinds set to MouseRight, ControllerY and Keyboard.X

This OPTIONAL configuration does not override or edit in-game keybinds for the action controls, instead it just enables the mod to detect when the action/use tool button has been pressed. This is useful in the case that the action button is mapped to a non-conventional input, such as a special button on non-standard controllers or gaming mice.

-----------------------------------------
Journal Button is a list of keybinds set to K
Effects button  is a list of keybinds set to :
Relics Button is a list of keybinds set to I
Herbalism Button is a list of keybinds set to O

These OPTIONAL configuration will open the Stardew Druid journal from the game world.

-----------------------------------------
Sort Journal by Active "activeJournal"
Reverse Journal "reverseJournal"

Sort and reverse the order in which Stardew Druid journal entries are displayed. Default: oldest to newest. Enabled: newest to oldest.

-----------------------------------------
Mod Difficulty (modDifficulty)

Determines how hard or easy the mod will be. Mod Difficulty affects stamina costs, custom monster strength and monetary rewards.

-----------------------------------------
Disable Cast Hands

Stardew Druid employs a 'pause and play single frame animation' for the farmer sprite when the rite button is used to trigger Druid events. This can be disabled to improve compatibility with mods that manage or modify the farmer sprite.

----------------------------------------- 
Set Milestone Progress "setMilestone"
Set Once "setOnce"
Convert 2.1.9 save "convert219"
Auto Progress "autoProgress"

Can be used to override the mod state on game load. 0 is the default for no effective change. See the progress list above. Set once will ensure that the value is set back to 0 to prevent any overridden states for other saves. Convert 2.1.9 will attempt to match legacy progress with the new progression. Auto progress will load the next lesson/quest at the start of each in game day, without the need to approach any of the quest NPCs.

-----------------------------------------
Slot Attune "slotAttune"
Slot Freedom "slotFreedom" (requires Slot Attunement)
Slot Consume "slotConsume"
Slot Reverse "slotReverse"
Slots 1 - 12

Can be used to configure whether to fix attunement to certain slots in the inventory and whether to auto-consume edible items. Can be further configured with slot freedom to enable any item to be held to cast, and slot reverse which consumes edibles from left to right instead of right to left. In addition, the slots themselves can be re-registered.

-----------------------------------------
Cultivate Behaviour
Adjusts the speed vs quality setting for RotW: Cultivate behaviour. 

1. Prioritises speed, with enhanced growth rate and speed fertiliser, and chance for extra harvest with RotF: Gravity Well
2. Balanced between the two
3. Prioritises quality, with quality fertiliser and better chance for quality harvest when harvested with RotF: Gravity Well

-----------------------------------------
Meteor Behaviour "meteorBehaviour"
Adjust the risk/reward setting that governs RotS: Meteor behaviour, including targetting, damage and coverage.

1. Prioritises Monsters, Stone Nodes and utilises a regular spatial pattern for optimal coverage. Normal damage. (default)
2. Monsters, Pattern, 1.1x damage
3. Stone Nodes, Pattern, 1.1x damage
4. Pattern only, 1.25x damage, 33% chance for large meteor
5. Completely random, 1.6x damage, 50% chance for large meteor

-----------------------------------------
Maximum Damage "maximumDamage"
Some spell effects have damage modifiers that consider player skill levels, druid level (mod progress) and applied enchantments.
Enable to apply max damage everytime. The damage shown is roughly the amount applied to monster health by one Stars:Meteor hit.

Maximum Damage (when enabled)
= 250

Calculated damage (when disabled, default)
5 * Combat Level    ~ 50 at end game
+ 2 * Mining Level    ~ 20 at end game
+ 2 * Foraging Level  ~ 20 at end game
+ Farming Level   ~ 10 at end game
+ Fishing Level   ~ 10 at end game
+ 3 * SD Druid Progress level ~ 120 at end
+ 25 if selected tool is enchanted

+ 25 for Brute Profession
= ~250-300 at end game, with more or less depending on Levels and SD Druid Progress

Cardinal Targetting

Disables isometric (6 way) targetting for transformation effects. Might look a little misaligned with the transformation animations."
