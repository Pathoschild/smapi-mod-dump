    "22210001.01": "So it is true! I heard you convinced the Junimos to move in, but I had to see it for myself.",
    "22210001.02": "Ahem. I am Rasmodius... I appear before you as the mighty Initial Configuration Wizard, tamer of the arcane.",
    "22210001.03": "There are a few things you need to know about the Junimos.",
    "22210001.04": "Shall I go on?",
    "22210001.05": "Please, I appreciate your other-worldy wisdom.",
    "22210001.06": "Another time perhaps. I have a lot of ducks to feed.",
    "22210001.07": "Cram it old man, I can figure this out myself.",
    "2221_continue_fu": "May your most vital orifices be clogged with dirt! To you I say, good day!",
    "2221_continue_y.01": "You only need to supply the items once, then the Junimos can perform that ability for ever.",
    "2221_continue_y.02": "Or I suppose I could just summon all the items they'll ever need right now.",
    "2221_continue_y.03": "What'll it be?",
    "2221_continue_y.04": "I'm a mighty adventurer, I'll quest for anything the Junimos need.",
    "2221_continue_y.05": "I'm just a humble farmer, please unlock all the abilities.",
    "2221_wages.01": "Secondly, the Junimos need to be paid for their hard work. Each day you need to give them a fruit, flower, or forage item and they'll get to work.",
    "2221_wages.02": "But there is another way. I could cast a spell to convince them to work for free...",
    "2221_wages.03": "What wages will you pay?",
    "2221_wages.04": "Do that spell thing so they work for free.",
    "2221_communicate.01": "I should teach you how to communicate with the Junimos.",
    "2221_communicate.02": "There's a box outside the hut. Put in seeds, fertilizer, wages, and items they request. Take out the crops, and forage they harvest.",
    "2221_communicate.03": "There's also a note in the hut that tells you if they're working and what they need. Read it if you're confused about what they're doing.",
    "2221_greenhouse": "The Junimos can enter your greenhouse, if it's within walking distance of their hut. They will not travel farther than that.",
    "2221_config.01": "Finally, you can change the working arrangements at any time. It's very flexible.",
    "2221_config.02": "Shall I show you the things you can change?",
    "2221_config.03": "Yes, show me all the options.",
    "2221_config.04": "No, I can look at options later.",
    "2221_end": "I may return periodically to study the Junimos and learn more about their ways. Rest assured though, your feeble mortal eyes will be unable to see me.",

    "dialogue.2221_continue_y": "Very well. First, the Junimos have many abilities, animal vegetable and mineral. But they need items, which they will request from you, to perform each ability.",
    "dialogue.2221_continue_n": "Very well. Good day to you, @.",
    "dialogue.2221_continue_fu": "You're not so clever @, if you think it wise to make an enemy of me.",
    "dialogue.2221_progression_y": "An admirable choice! The Junimos' needs will take you on many adventures.",
    "dialogue.2221_progression_n": "I understand. You wield a hoe, not a sword.",
    "dialogue.2221_fruit": "A very suitable choice, @.",
    "dialogue.2221_flowers": "To brighten the Junimos' day. Very good.",
    "dialogue.2221_forage": "The bounty of the forest, how apt.",
    "dialogue.2221_all": "A fair and generous choice, @.",
    "dialogue.2221_none": "As you wish. It's not for me to decide what's fair.",
    "dialogue.2221_config_y": "Then I will leave you to look over it. Good day to you, @.",
    "dialogue.2221_config_n": "I have many other things to do anyway. Good day to you, @."
