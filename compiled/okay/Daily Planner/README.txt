#### MevNav's Daily Planner Mod ####

Current version: 1.2.2
Last Update: June 12th, 2023
* Fixed crash related to opening checklist menu on new saves.


How to install this mod:
1) Install SMAPI.
2) Drag the folder "DailyPlanner" into Stardew Valley/Mods folder. 
3) Install Generic Mod Config Menu to change settings in-game (highly recommended).
4) Boot up the game and change the keybinding for the Daily Planner menu with Generic Mod Config. 

How to create a plan: 
1) Load up your game.
2) Press [ button (left bracket) to bring up the menu. (I recommend changing this button using Generic Mod Config Menu to 'Z')
3) Click on "Add Task" tab
4) Use +/- buttons to select when to add a daily, weekly, or one-day task.
5) Type the name of your task into the text field. 
6) Click "Set" to add the task. 
7) Repeat until all your tasks are added!

How to create a checklist:
1) Load up your game.
2) Open the menu as shown above.
3) Click on "Checklist" tab.
4) Type your task into the text field at the top.
5) Click "Set" to add the task.
6) Repeat until all your task are added!

How to save/edit/back up your plans or checklist:
The files for your daily planner and checklist can be found in your Stardew Valley save folder. On Windows, this can be found at...
%appdata%\StardewValley\Saves\[save game name]\DailyPlanner
Assuming you've booted up your save game with this mod before, you will find the file 'year_1.json' and 'Checklist.txt'.
Checklist.txt is the easiest to edit yourself, feel free to type in a big long list there and save it. 
The .json files are a little harder to edit, but you can easily copy a previous year and save it as 'year_2.json' or something similar like that.

Upcoming features:
* Allow users to change the order of tasks in the daily planner and checklist menu
* Support for To-Dew mod (so To-Dew and Daily Planner doesn't fight over HUD space, and perhaps even share resources)
* Multiplayer support, allowing collaborative planning and task completion (I need someone to help me test this)
* Perhaps further mobile phone support, with an actual app that shows tasks on your phone screen? Might be a good alternative to the hud overlay.

Known issues: 
* Due to needing to be able to save in a local save directory, the mod is disabled if you're a farmhand in a multiplayer game. Multiplayer support will be added later.
* Long text can trail off the right side of the planner menu.
* Issue with the scroll bar when scrolled all the way down then removing a task.
