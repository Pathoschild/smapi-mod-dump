Wizard's Mystical Stationary MOD  by Taskmaster


Introduction
------------
The Wizard of Pelican Town, M. Rasmodius, recently obtained some new mystical stationary from a contact at the Night Market.  Supposedly it came directly from
the mystics of the Far East.  This MOD provides several stationary options for letters sent by the Wizard.  You can elect to always use your favorite or let
one be chosen randomly.  There are 5 new designs to choose from:

Configuration
-------------
The configuration allows you to subscribe to as many or as few of the Monthly Mail letters as desired.  You also get to decide which day you would like to receive
a given newsletter.  You can even have them all arrive on the same day if you wanted, although the default schedule scatters them across a given month.

StationaryId: This value defaults to 0 (random), but can be set to a speific stationary as desired: 1 - 5.   Valid frame values are: 0 = Randomly Selected, 
			  1 = Rainbow Nebula, 2 = Darkmoon Rising, 3 = Color Splash, 4 = Purple Abyss and 5 = Green Chaos

IncludeOriginal: True if you want the orignal Wizard stationary to be included when selecting a random stationary.  Does not apply if you specify a
                 specific stationary to use.  Otherwise False

If you are a Steam user, I have created two Community Guides that you might enjoy.  They are not your typical regurgitation of the Stardew Valley Wiki,
but are short stories based on the game designed to add "lore" to the game experience.  Folks seem to enjoy them and I am sure you will too.
