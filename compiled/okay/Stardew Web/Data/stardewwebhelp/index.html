        Through the use of SMAPI adds a Web Portal to the game.  Provides an all-in-one place to track your progress as a Farmer in the dating world and the world of Perfection.  You can customize the information displayed to show as little
        or as much as you want.  Some of the information that can be displayed is considered "cheats", which is a fair description.  Don't consider warping cheating?  Enable it.
        The Portal can be configured to show you no more than the vanilla game will or it can be set to open up a whole world of information.<br /><br />
