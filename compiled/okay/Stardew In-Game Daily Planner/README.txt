#### MevNav's In-Game Daily Planner Mod ####

This is the 0.5 version of this mod. The GUI is pretty much ripped out of the Cheat Menu Mod. In version 1.0, an in-game way to add tasks will be added.

How to install this mod:
1) Install SMAPI.
2) Drag the folder "DailyPlanner" into Stardew Valley/Mods folder. 
3) Go into Stardew Valley/Mods/DailyPlanner/Plans and create a .CSV plan file for the year you want to plan.
4) Go into Stardew Valley/Mods/DailyPlanner/Plans and edit Checklist.txt, adding tasks you want to complete.

How to create a plan: 
1) In your Stardew Valley/Mods/DailyPlanner/Plans folder, and find the "Template.CSV" file.
2) From here, you can either...
	a) Create a copy of this file in the same folder, making sure NOT to delete or rename the original file. (Recommended)
﻿	b) Open your game and load a save file for the year you want to plan. The mod will notice the .csv file is missing, and create a blank one from the template.
	c) Create a blank file with the .CSV extension in this folder, and copy the Template.CSV content into it with a text editor or spreadsheet program.
3) Rename the newly created copy file to whatever year you are making a plan for. For example, if planning for year 1, rename it "1.csv". 
4) Open the file with the spreadsheet program of your choice. 
5) To the right of the "Daily - Year" cell, fill in a row of tasks you want to be reminded of every day for the entire year.
6) To the right of the "Daily - Spring" cell, fill in a row of tasks you want to be reminded of every day of Spring. Do the same for Summer, Fall, and Winter.
7) Finally, to the right of the "Spring 1" cell, fill in a row of tasks you want to be reminded of on that particular day. Do the same for every other day.
8) Close and save your spreadsheet program, then boot up Stardew Valley. You're ready to go!

How to create a checklist:
1) In your Stardew Valley/Mods/DailyPlanner/Plans folder, and find the "Checklist.txt" file. 
2) If it does not exist, create it, or open the menu in-game to create one.
3) Open this file in notepad or something similar, and add a list of things you want to do, one task for each line. 
4) Save and close your file, then open your in-game menu again. Unlike plans, you can edit checklists at any time. 

How to use this mod:
1) Press "tab" while the game is loaded to see your tasks for the day.
2) Click "set" on a task to mark it as completed. Repeat until you've done everything. 
3) Click on the various tabs on the side to look at different options.

Upcoming features:
1) Ability to add (and possibly remove) tasks to your plan while in-game, rather than having to rely on a spreadsheet program.
2) "Refresh" button to reload your .csv file in the middle of the day. 
3) More languages, maybe?

Known issues: 
1) .CSV format is a nice, cross-platform format, but it's still not the optimal way to create a plan. Might switch to something else in the future...
2) Does not currently support multiple save files. All your save files will read the same plans. 
3) Occasionally, the date in the menu will be wrong when you first wake up. This should go away once it hits 7:10 AM. 
4) You might get a read error if you still have your spreadsheet program open. Make sure to close it before you start playing your game. 
5) Mid-day edits to your .CSV plan file will not be registered until a new day. Might be fixed with a button that will let you "refresh" your plan and re-read your file. 
6) For related reasons, the mod won't read your .CSV file if you somehow start the game up at any time other than at the start of the day.
