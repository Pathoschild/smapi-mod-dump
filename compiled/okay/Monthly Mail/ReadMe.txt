Monthly Mail MOD  by Taskmaster


Introduction
------------
This MOD provides a mailbag full of game-related newletters that you can subscribe to.  You are free to opt into (or out of) any topics that interest you, such as
the Adventurer's Guild Newletter, feturing differnt monster kill stats each season, the Dairy Council update, discussing your milk, cheese and egg production, 
the Fishing Scene magazine, your Fitness update, Dad's Letters (and lame jokes), Fruit of the Month Club, Top Ten Items Shipped and more!  The content of each letter
generally changes per month so you shouldn't get bored!


Configuration
-------------
The configuration allows you to subscribe to as many or as few of the Monthly Mail letters as desired.  You also get to decide which day you would like to receive
a given newsletter.  You can even have them all arrive on the same day if you wanted, although the default schedule scatters them across a given month.

AdventureGuild, defaults to the arrival on the 15th of the month, but you can set this to any value from 0 (opt-out) to 28.

DadLetters, defaults to the arrival on the 7th of the month, but you can set this to any value from 0 (opt-out) to 28.

DairyCouncil, defaults to the arrival on the 2nd of the month, but you can set this to any value from 0 (opt-out) to 28.

FishingScene, defaults to the arrival on the 18th of the month, but you can set this to any value from 0 (opt-out) to 28.

Fitness, defaults to the arrival on the 20th of the month, but you can set this to any value from 0 (opt-out) to 28.

FruitClub, defaults to the arrival on the 23rd of the month, but you can set this to any value from 0 (opt-out) to 28.

GreenPiece, defaults to the arrival on the 11th of the month, but you can set this to any value from 0 (opt-out) to 28.

Mining4Ores, defaults to the arrival on the 24th of the month, but you can set this to any value from 0 (opt-out) to 28.

TopTenItemsShipped, defaults to the arrival on the 28th of the month, but you can set this to any value from 0 (opt-out) to 28.

This configuration setting is not a newsletter.

ColoredEnvelopes - True if you want colored envelopes to be shown when the mailboxes contains a Monthly Mail.  False will use the default game envelope.
                   NOTE: This impacts the new 1.14 letter tab as well.  If that bothers you just turn this off.

Conclusion
----------
If you like this MOD you might want to check out my "Junk Mail" mod as well: https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/4452/
or "Train Whistle" mod, that lets you summmon the train basically anytime: https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/4473

If you are a Steam user, I have created two Community Guides that you might enjoy.  They are not your typical regurgitation of the Stardew Valley Wiki,
but are short stories based on the game designed to add "lore" to the game experience.  Folks seem to enjoy them and I am sure you will too.
