  "AcceptGift_(O)StardropTea": "Wow, this is a rare substance. I'll have to take it to the lab for... uh... further analysis.",
  "AcceptBirthdayGift_Positive": "A present!... with optimal timing. Today is the anniversary of my birth. Thank you!$h",
  "AcceptBirthdayGift_Negative": "A present!... with optimal timing. Today is the anniversary of my birth.$h#$b#Let's see what it is... $h#$b#...Oh.$s",
  "AcceptGift_(O)107": "Wow, an intact dinosaur egg! This is an extremely rare specimen. Now, if only it could be incubated...",
  "Resort_Entering": "I already spotted a rare crab. This place is great.$h",
  "GreenRain": "Don't mind me, @. I'm just collecting some samples. This may be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity!$7#$e#Erm... If you see my wife, can you tell her I'm okay?$7",
  "GreenRain_2": "The rain appears to be harmless, so I'm taking less precaution this year.",
  "firstVisit_Desert": "I heard you visited Calico Desert recently. How fascinating! I'm sure you observed many unique life forms on your trip.",
  "questComplete_104_memory_oneday": "Checking up on the melon research? Yes, I... uh... 'analyzed' it, and it certainly has an optimal macronutrient profile...",
  "purchasedAnimal_Dinosaur": "Say that again!? You successfully incubated a dinosaur egg? This is unprecedented!$5#$e#Here, take my coffee, I'm all worked up now... I can't drink any more. [253]",
  "dating_Maru": "Yes, Maru told me the news. I can't say I'm thrilled about it, but maybe you'll prove me wrong.$u",

  "married_Sebastian": "Congratulations on the marriage. Jinja's been crying since the wedding. 'Tears of joy', as she calls it! A most peculiar concept...#$e#Hmm, now that the basement is unoccupied, I might have to expand the laboratory...$u",
  "eventSeen_65_memory_oneweek": "$y 'How's that cave experiment coming along? Has it produced anything of value yet?_Yes_Ah! That means the conditions must be more suitable than I originally theorized... hmm..._No_Well, keep checking on it every now and then. I'm sure those little guys will yield something eventually.'",
  "eventSeen_65_memory_twoweeks": "Don't forget to check that farm cave! There's bound to be something useful in there by now.",
  "Resort_Leaving": "I'll be analyzing this data for months.",
  "Resort_Shore": "*crunch*... whoops, there goes an endangered crab species...$s#$b#...#$b#Oh, nevermind. It was just the empty shell! I can sleep tonight.",
  "Resort_Chair": "Are you having fun, @? You need to remember to take breaks now and then too!",
  "Resort_Bar": "I usually don't partake... but I'm usually not on a tropical island, either. Hahaha.$h",
  "Resort": "Can you believe this place? It's teeming with exotic life!",

  "Mon": "Maru helps me out in the lab sometimes... She's a good kid.",
  "Mon_inlaw_Maru": "It's hard to do good science without Maru's help...#$b#But her happiness is much more important than my experiment!",
  "Tue": "This valley has a very vibrant and diverse ecosystem. That's one reason I was excited to move here.",
  "Wed": "You're probably growing a lot of interesting plants on your farm, huh?#$e#Maybe I'll stop by your place some day and check it out.",
  "Thu": "How's the farming business going? It's parsnip season, isn't it?#$e#I can imagine it being pretty peaceful, working outdoors with plants all day.",
  "Fri": "Jinja has a hot temper. It's better to stay on her good side.#$e#Don't tell her I said that.$h",
  "Sat": "Let's see... If compounds in the rhizosphere contain sufficient levels of Carbon-13, then...$u#$b#Oh! Sorry. I was pondering some data and I didn't notice you there.#$e#Do you need anything?",
  "Sun": "It's good to take a break from work every now and then.#$e#I guess that's kind of difficult when you live on a farm, though.#$e#Hey, at least in the winter you don't have to worry about crops.",
  "Fri4": "Jinja has a hot temper. It's better to stay on her good side.#$e#...now if I could only quantify her mood levels, perhaps I could model the fluctuations using a sinusoidal curve...$u",
  "Wed6": "Hi @! How are you doing today?#$e#I wish I could make your farming job easier somehow.",
  "Event_tomato1": "Really? I figured a farmer would know the correct answer...$s",
  "Event_tomato2": "See? @ agrees with me.",

  "summer_Thu": "How's the farming business going? It's tomato season, isn't it?#$e#I can imagine it being pretty peaceful, working outdoors with plants all day.",
  "summer_Fri": "$p 40#So I heard Maru had you look through that telescope out back.|If you and Maru become friends, I'm sure she'll show you how to use that telescope out back.#$e#Pretty exciting, huh?",
  "summer_Fri_inlaw_Maru": "I hope my daughter's keeping up on her math and science!",
  "summer_Sat": "Hmm... If strigolactone levels could be increased, would it have a proportional effect on mycorhizal growth?$u#$b#Oh! Sorry. I was pondering some data and I didn't notice you there.#$e#Do you need anything?",
  "summer_Mon6": "I became a scientist because I wanted to contribute to the progression of our species.#$e#Of course, none of this would be possible without farmers such as yourself.$h",
  "fall_Mon": "During this time of year I divert my attentions to fungi.",
  "fall_Tue": "We know a lot about nature thanks to science.#$e#But there's always a lot more to learn.",
