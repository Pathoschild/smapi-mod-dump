SpawnFreqencyInSeconds:
	DON'T USE DECIMALS
	There is alway a randomness of +-1 second 
	(e.g.: if set to 5, a crow will spawn every 4 to 6 seconds)
	(you cant go lower that 1 second -> range of 0 to 2 seconds)

SpawnRadiusAroundFarmer:
	DON'T USE DECIMALS
	(e.g.: if set to 5, a crow can spawn in a range of 5 tiles around the farmer)

MakeSpawnSound:
	ONLY USE "true" or "false"
	true to make a "Pop" sound on crow spawn
	false to turn off the "Pop" sound on crow spawn
