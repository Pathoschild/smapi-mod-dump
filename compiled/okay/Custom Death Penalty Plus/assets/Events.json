    /*
        These entries are the edited events shown to the player after death, depending on the config settings. Feel free to edit them to suit your preferences, just note a few things:       
        {0} for the first four entries is replaced with the player name
        {1} in the first three entries is a response said by Harvey depending on config settings
        DO NOT remove any characters enclosed in {} in the last entry or change when they appear in the script, they contain coordinates and the event location from CDPP
        hospitaldeath should always be included before ending the event, it tells the game to apply the death penalties (which CDPP will then change)
