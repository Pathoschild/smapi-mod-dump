How to use
Press K In Game to open the UI and configure your settings.
The screenshots are saved in the screenshot directory in the game in a folder named as your farm(be sure to have an unique name for each of your games you want to monitor).
Then you can use a video editor to create your timelaps (I use ImageJ to make an avi file from the screenshots separated in a few hundreds files. 
	then I use the vindows video editor to finalize the movie)

Compatibility
