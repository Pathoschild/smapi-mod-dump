ItemBags will automatically load modded bag json files located in:
"<ItemBagsInstallFolder>\assets\Modded Bags"

So to use these sample files, just copy them into that folder, then re-launch Stardew Valley.

To create a file for another mod, consider using the SMAPI command "generate_modded_bag" to create a file with default settings.
Then open the file in a text editor and change the basic settings like name, description, price etc to your liking.
Type "help generate_modded_bag" into the SMAPI console for more information.
