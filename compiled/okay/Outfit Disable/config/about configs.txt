When you install this mod and run the game, json files will be created with the following content.

{
  "Default": false,
  "ExceptionsList": {}
}

* true or false: Outfit is disabled when value is true.
* "Default": Applies to all NPCs, who is not in exceptions.
* "ExceptionsList": Applicable NPCs are applied as defined in the exception, regardless of the value of Default.

You can write exceptions like following format:

{
  "Default": false,
  "ExceptionsList": {
    "Abigail": true,
    "Alex": false,
    "(WhoeverYouWant)": (true or false)
  }
}

There is no limit to the size of the list.
