Leave the files to be changed, in a file structure like what is in Stardew Valley's Content folder, in this mod's assets folder.
E.g.: To have the 'Data/Bundles' file replaced, you can add a 'Data' folder to the 'assets' folder, and insert a "Bundles.xnb" or "Bundles.json" file, in the 'Data' folder.
This mod accepts .xnb, .json, .png, .tbin and .tmx files. .txt files are ignored by the replacer.
NOTHING ELSE Should be in the 'assets' folder.
