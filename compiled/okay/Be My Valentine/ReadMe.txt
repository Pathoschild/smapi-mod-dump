Be My Valentine MOD by Taskmaster


Introduction
------------
I appreciate that you took a few moments to check out another of my silly mail MODs.  This MOD will send a handful of Valentine messages to the player
on the 14th of Spring (or the season you configure).  These are not meant to be "love interest" Valentines, but like as school kids, just brotherly and
sisterly love, with sappy messages.   They are not currently tied to any heart events.  I mmay add that enhancement in the future.

This MOD will replace the normal letter background with a Valentine's Day themed one, except for any Wizard letters, but only on the 14th of Spring (or 
configured season).  The background will be applied to any normal letter you happen to receive on the 14th as well, again except for letters on Wizard 
stationary.  Currently there is only a single set of Valentine's Day letters.  Eventually I hope to expand it to add a little more variety, but for now
I just wanted to provide so Valentine's Day fun.

The mail leter background is also used in other places and probably other mods, so the Valentine;s background may appear in odd placed based on that.  I hope you
can overlook that as I cannot really correct that with my current level of understanding of Stardew Valley code.  I am sure I could replace the background after all
mail had been read for the day, but that is a bit more than I was thinking of for now.

This MOD may not be uploaded to any web site.  It is only authorized to be included on Nexus Mods.  Please respect my rights.  Do not frequent
sites that steal content, such as Stardew Valley Mods.  Thanks!


Configuration
-------------
It was pointed out by Purr0wpet that the idiotic mod author put Valentine's Day in Spring when it occurs in Winter at all the locations outside of
Stardew Valley.  I fired that guy and decided to make it a configurable option, rather than admit my - uh - his mistake.  ;P

Season - can be set to "Spring", "Summer", "Fall" or "Winter", but it will default to Spring since that is where it was placed originally by the mod.


History
-------
v1.0.0     - Initial Release

If you are a Steam user, I have created two Community Guides that you might enjoy.  They are not your typical regurgitation of the Stardew Valley Wiki,
but are short stories based on the game designed to add "lore" to the game experience.  Folks seem to enjoy them and I am sure you will too.

By the way, if you wanted to give me a little support - about $1 - then consider buying my book/ebook on Amazon.  It is Minecraft inspired, but is a collection
of short stories along the same line as the two above.  So if you liked those you will enjoy the book.  I'm never really sure that I am getting the royalty as
obviously I don't sell many, so leave me a comment if you actually buy a copy so I can verify Amazon is paying me.   Thanks all!
