"Train Whistle" MOD by Taskmaster
(C) 2019, All Rights Reserved


Introduction
------------
Use the powerful jade train whistle to summon a train almost at will.  You will receive a letter with details as part of the MOD.

NOTE: If you ran version 1.0.0 of the Train Whistle MOD, before the whsitle was included, you will need to use the consol command, dicussed below, in order
to receive the jade train whistle mail.

WARNING!  This mod puts a 3 in-game hour rest between train summons as a buffer, but please do not attempt to summon a train if there is already a train in progress.
          It could potentially result in a crash or corrupted save.


Please do not upload this MOD to any sites.  It is only authorized to be on Nexus Mods.  Do not frequent Stardew Valley MODS as they steal content!!  Thank you.


Configuration
-------------
There are two adjustable options in the config.json file that will be created upon first run.  These options are explained in detail below:

ShowDebug - This option will display debug notifications to the console window when set to "true".  This MOD doesn't have much in th way of debug information
            at the moment, so not much use.

TrainWhistleObjectId - This option will be very important for folks who have a lot of mods that add new crops, flowers, object, etc., such as using Json Assets (JA).
                       if you find that the jade train whistle corrupts one of the objects from another mod, you can adjust the Id that Train Whistle is using.  The
                       default Id is 960, but you can use any Id up to 3048 currently.   I would hope one of those Ids would not be used.  However, if you need, you
                       set the Id to a 0 and the jade train whistle will not be added to the content.  You can summon the train using your axe by "hitting" the RxR
                       Crossing Sign near the tracks.


Console Command
---------------
In the event it is necessary to receive the instuctional mail again, type the following command in the SMAPI console window.  If you played verions 1.0.0 of
the mod you should execute this command after loading your saved game (Alt-Tab to SMAPI window) to reset the event.

     reset_trainwhistle

Conclusion
----------
If you like this MOD you might want to check out my "Junk Mail" mod (https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/4452/) or my Monthly Mail mod 
(https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/4523) for more silly and zany fun.

If you are a Steam user, I have created two Community Guides that you might enjoy.  They are not your typical regurgitation of the Stardew Valley Wiki,
but are short stories based on the game designed to add "lore" to the game experience.  Folks seem to enjoy them and I am sure you will too.
