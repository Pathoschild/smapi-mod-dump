Zen Mod 1.0.2
Stand still for three seconds and time will stop, allowing you to stop and think, or just relax in your surroundings for a while. Toggle ZenMod (it's on by default) by pressing default key RightControl (change in config.json).

:: REQUIREMENTS ::
• SMAPI

:: FEATURES ::
• Time stops when you do not perform any action for three seconds.
• Time does not stop when fishing (1.0.1)
• You can now press default key RightControl to toggle ZenMod off and on. This key can be changed in config.json.

:: GENERAL OTHER STUFF ::
• Time may still tick over to the next clock tick, because it takes three seconds for zen mode to activate. This is intentional as I don't want this mod to feel like a cheat, but rather feel like a game mechanic.

:: DISCLAIMER ::
• This mod has not been tested with many other mods, but was launched through SMAPI when programmed. Use mod at your own risk! Manipulates the game's time interval, so other mods that manipulate time interval may not work perfectly. However, it should work with TimeSpeed mod from my limited amount of testing.

::  KNOWN ISSUES ::
• Will add here if issues are known but not fixed in the next update.
