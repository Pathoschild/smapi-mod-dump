Zen Mod 1.0.1
Stand still for three seconds and time will stop, allowing you to stop and think, or just relax in your surroundings for a while.

:: REQUIREMENTS ::
• SMAPI

:: FEATURES ::
• Time stops when you do not perform any action for three seconds.
• Time does not stop when fishing (1.0.1)

:: GENERAL OTHER STUFF Template ::
• Time may still tick over to the next clock tick, because it takes three seconds for zen mode to activate. This is intentional as I don't want this mod to feel like a cheat, but rather feel like a game mechanic.

:: DISCLAIMER ::
• This mod has not been tested with any other mods, but was launched through SMAPI when programmed. Use mod at your own risk! Manipulates the game's time interval, so may not work splendidly with oter mods that also do that.

::  KNOWN ISSUES ::
• Will add here if issues are known but not fixed in the next update.
