  "Explaination": "SpawnChancePerTile is not how you think - A bigger number will *decrease* the number of mobs being spawned - At a setting of 1, it will spawn a mob on every single valid tile. This is very laggy. Recommend 100 for a balanced experience, 50 for a more intense one, and 25 for a fight for your life.",
