Stardew Voices - Voice Over Mod for Stardew Valley


:: REQUIREMENTS ::
• SMAPI: https://smapi.io/

:: FEATURES::
• Voice Over audio added for Abigail's Dialogue. This includes events, festivals, general dialogue, marriage dialogue, and text bubbles.
• Menu for controlling dialogue volume separate from the game audio. Access this by pressing "V".

::  KNOWN ISSUES ::
• Dialogue constructed dynamically is only partially supported. Dialogue will still play if there is a custom variable (player name, random nouns, etc) but it will NOT play if the line was constructed using multiple different dialogue lines:
	Ex: "Did you know that my dad hates 'Garlic'? He finds it absolutely sickening. I think he might be 		allergic." Is constructed with TWO different dialogue lines.
• (Spoiler) The audio of Abigail playing a video game with the farmer in her heart event is not voiced.
• Some lines may be missing
