	// To make a content pack for this mod you need to create a spritesheet for your NPC with 2 sprites,
	// the actual animation sprite and the ending sprite. Name the spritesheet with the pattern NPCNAME_Love.png and save
	// in the assets folder of your mod.
	// I recommend not to use the first line of the spritesheet because it cause a issue when flipping the sprite.
	// Then create a npc.json like above:
	{
		"Name": "Julia", //The name of the NPC
		"NpcFrame1": 4, // The frame of the NPC sprite sheet that should be used while making love. 
		// Start with 0 and go from left to right, top to botton.
		// the frame after this must be the animation's ending sprite.
		"Passive": true, // if the NPC is acting as a passive actor of the animation, otherwise false
		"FrameDirectionRight": false //True if the frame is facing right, false if facing left.
	} //Place a comma here add more than one NPC.
