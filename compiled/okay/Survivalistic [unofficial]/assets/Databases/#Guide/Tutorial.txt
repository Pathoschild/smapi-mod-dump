How to create your own compatibility patch:

1º: Create a .json file in the "/assets/Databases/Custom/{1}/{2}" folder, where: 
	{1} — Author ID of the mod. For example, with "SMAPI.ConsoleCommands" this will be "SMAPI";
	{2} — Mod name. With the previous example it will be "ConsoleCommands".
		Note: If mod doesn't have author and mod name in standalone form, left file in "Custom" folder.
	that you want to make the compatibility file and "_Edibles" in the end of the line, like in the "EXAMPLE_Edibles.json".

2º: Modify the values respecting the structure of the example file (Unique Item Name and feed/hydrate values).

3º: Save and run the game.
