  "WizardTeleportMail": "Greetings @,^I was sorting through my volumes of arcane tomes and came across an old spell that I think you could^get some use out of.^It's a simple teleportation spell, though for one unpracticed in the arcane arts, it will likely wear you out to use too frequently.^With practice, you may find you can grow to use it without expending any energy at all.^^M. Rasmodius",
  "WizardTeleportMailAdvanced": "Greeting @!^I've been watching closely since my last message, and your training seems to be progressing well.^I'm sure you've noticed an increased affinity for the magic around you. In fact, I'm sure if you tried, you could now gather the necessary energy^for that basic teleportation spell from the world around you, rather than your own internal reserves^^Give it a try when you have a chance.^M. Rasmodius"
