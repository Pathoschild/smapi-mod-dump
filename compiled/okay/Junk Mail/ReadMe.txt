Junk Mail MOD by Taskmaster

Introduction
------------
Thanks for taking time to give my silly MOD a try.  This MOD will occassionally, based on random chance, send the player game-related junk mail.
The mail is designed to add a little extra "lore" to the game in some cases, or to just be fun in other cases.  Each junk mail will only be sent
once so that you are not reading the same thing over and over.

sites that steal content, such as Stardew Valley Mods.  Thanks!


Configuration
-------------
There are some adjustable options in the config.json file that will be created upon first run.  These options are explained in detail below:

MailChance - This is the percaent chance - roughly - that a junk mail will be sent to the player.  It defaults to 10 (10%).  Setting this value to 0
             will result in no mail being sent, while setting it to 100 (100%) will result in a junk mail arriving every day.

MailNotification - This MOD will display a notification first thing in the morning if you have awaiting mail.  Set this value to "None" if you
                   do not wish to receive this notification.  "Basic", the default, will show a simple "You've Got Mail" message.  Lastly, if
				   you set this value to "detailed", you will be given a message that indicates the number of letters that are in the mailbox.

MailReplay - This MOD will only send each junk mail once, and after all junk mail has been sent (18 or so) it will not repeat by default.  You can
             set this value to "true" if you want the MOD to reset and start sending the junk mail again.

ShowDebug - This option will display debug notifications to the console window whne set to "true".  This has no value unless you are just curious.


Console Command
---------------
You may also reset the sent mail using the following command in the SMAPI console window.

     reset_junkmail

If you like this MOD you might want to check out my "Train Whistle" mod (https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/4473)

If you are a Steam user, I have created two Community Guides that you might enjoy.  They are not your typical regurgitation of the Stardew Valley Wiki,
but are short stories based on the game designed to add "lore" to the game experience.  Folks seem to enjoy them and I am sure you will too.
