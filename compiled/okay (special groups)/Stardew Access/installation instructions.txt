Copy the files in the libraries folder according to you OS and paste them into the Stardew Valley root folder (the folder containing the Mods folder and the StardewModdingAPI).

This is a one time process, you won't have to repeat this after updating the mod to next version.

TTS should work after this and in case it doesn't, try copying the files over to the mod's folder as well.
