"Fantastic Frames" MOD by Taskmaster


Introduction
------------
This mod adds 20 new dialog frame backgrounds to provide variety and spice things up, but it is not pixel art.  If you prfer mods that only use pixel art, then you
should skip this one.  It was just a simple idea that no one else had done so I wanted to toss it out.  If there is enough interest I will add a few more choices.


Notice
------
This MOD is only authorized to be offered via Nexus Mods.  If you obtained it elsewhere that site is stealing.  You should not patronize them!  Do not 
upload this MOD to any other site as I do not allow that.  Thank you.


Configuration
-------------
There are two adjustable options in the config.json file that will be created upon first run.  These options are explained in detail below:

FantasticFrameId - Set this option to the frame background that you prefer, or set the value to 0 and the mod will randomly select a frame each new day.
                   Valid frame values are: 0 = Randomly Selected, 1 = Aged Wood, 2 = Plywood, 3 = Wood Paneling, 4 = Reclaimed Wood, 5 = Textured Wood,
                                           6 = Cherry Wood, 7 = Red Brick, 8 = Pink Brick, 9 = Colored Brick, 10 = Pink Marble, 11 = Jade, 12 = Sapphire,
                                           13 = Amethyst, 14 = Mother of Pearl, 15 = Ivy, 16 = Stained Glass, 17 = Citrine, 18 = Granite, 19 = Melted Wax,
                                 	       20 = Colored Lights


Console Command
---------------
You can change the selected frame during the game using this Console Command, but it requires a cache invalidation so use it sparingly. The Id can be 0 to 20.

     FantasticFrames_selectFrame Id


History
-------
v1.0.0     - Initial Release
v1.0.1     - Corrected the wrong frame being shown for the specified Id, added 4 more designs, and updated the relationship indicator to match frame.

If you are a Steam user, I have created two Community Guides that you might enjoy.  They are not your typical regurgitation of the Stardew Valley Wiki,
but are short stories based on the game designed to add "lore" to the game experience.  Folks seem to enjoy them and I am sure you will too.
