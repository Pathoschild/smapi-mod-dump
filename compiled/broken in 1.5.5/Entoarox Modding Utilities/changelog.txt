# 0.1.3
- Fixed the crashing issue present in 0.1.2
- Cleanup and general typo-fixes
- Fix a issue where reverse TypeId would wrongly report sdv.object:* instances as sdv.craftable:* instances
- Added a texture stitching system under the TextureStitcher namespace
- Added a more advanced localization system under the I18n namespace

# 0.2.0
- Added TDiffPatcher, supports revision 0 and revision 1 tdiff files

# 0.3.0
- SpriteAtlas is now a IEnumerable<KeyValuePair<string, Sprite>> to allow parsing all sprites in a atlas
- Added support for xnb-packed files to SpriteAtlas, xnb files of the same name are loaded in favour of their png counterpart
 - Requires xnb mode to be enabled by providing a Func<string, Texture2D> to handle the actual xnb loading


# 0.4.1
- New API function `SanitizeMap`
 - Sanitizes and error-checks map properties that often have issues, also whitelists a few characters to enable easier readability of these properties
- Improved artisan object handling by adding a new id syntax `sdv.artisan:TYPE,SUBID` where `TYPE` is the type of artisan object, and `SUBID` is the full TypeId of a non-artisan item
 - This removes any collision issues where multiple typeId's might have the same id and thus the wrong type of artisan object being generated

# 0.4.1
- Fixed an issue with how pathing support was handled for `FarBack` and `MidBack` layers
    - Animated tiles on these layers without a tile on the `Back` layer above them now remain animated
