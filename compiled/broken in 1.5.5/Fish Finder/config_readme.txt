## Configuration Setting

### Overview of config json file
Once this mod is installed and you have the fishing rod you can adjust some settings.  
If you don't have a config.json file, then the config file will be created when you first run Stardew Valley with this mod.
You should not need to adjust the configuration settings but if you do, here are what the setting are inside the config.json file:

#### showHudData
Shows the hud when player is holding the fishing rod.   
- Default Value: true 

#### hudXPostion
The upper left corner X coordinate of the hud position.  The top left corner of the screen is 0,0.  If this value > 0 then it moves the hud right.    
- Default Value: 0 

#### hudYPostion
The upper left corner Y coordinate of the hud position.  The top left corner of the screen is 0,0.  If this value > 0 then it moves the hud down.    
Note: If you use the [UI Info Suite](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1150), A good setting is 200 for this.
- Default Value: 0 

#### showDistance
Shows the distance to the fishing spot in the hud when player is holding the fishing rod.  
- Default Value: true 

#### configVersion
Don't modify.  This is used to update the config file if new settings are added.
- Default Value: 1
