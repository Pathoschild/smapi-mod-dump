    // IMPORTANT NOTES
    // Some data entries below include event scripts and dialogue with keys or symbols that should not be changed or removed.
    // Please be careful not to remove symbols, dialogue keys, or special character sequences (like \" or _ or #$b# or $y) when translating.
    // For example, @ is a placeholder for player name, %farm is a placeholder for farm name, and %rival gives a random same-gender name.
    // https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Event_data (how Stardew event scripts work)
    // https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Dialogue#Format (Stardew dialogue formatting)

    // If you are creating a new translation, making gender-neutral "-gn" dialogue variants dialogue is optional.
    // It's easier in some langauges than others, and not everyone is familiar with gender-neutral grammar alteratives used in their language.
    // Feel free to submit a partial translation with only standard dialogue keys. Someone else can add the -gn variant later.
