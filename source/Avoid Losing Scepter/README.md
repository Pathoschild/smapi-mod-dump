Avoid Losing Specter
===========================

![Header image](AvoidLosingScepter/docs/banner.jpg)

This mod prevents you from losing the Return Specter on death. Also prevents loss of the horse flute, and golden scythe.

## Install

1. Install the latest version of [SMAPI](https://smapi.io).
2. Download this mod and unzip it into `Stardew Valley/Mods`.
3. Run the game using SMAPI.

## Uninstall
Simply remove this mod from your Mods folder.

## Compatibility

* Works with Stardew Valley 1.5.6 on Linux/macOS/Windows.
* Works in single player, multiplayer, and split-screen mode. In multiplayer, all players should install.
* Should be compatible with most other mods. 

* A note: [Moon Misadventures](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/10612) has its own way of preventing you from losing certain things on death, so this mod doesn't work if you have that one installed. (I didn't feel like transpiling another mod today.)
