[Intended Function:]

	To add immersive diary function to Stardew Valley, hopefully making it able to have a new page for every day spent in game.  The resulting journal will be externally saved so the player
can read or share it with anyone they want to.  Would like to have optional page designs for customization in game.

[To Do:]

1. Clear out any errors and test default code, given by M3ales.
2. Start to make a paging system.
3. Change interface to have page images that can be selected by the player. Need to create images for the pages.
4. Enable saving to a text file with Dates and divisions.



[Resolutions:]

1. Updated and cleared all Errors!  Thank you Pathos!
2. Paging System Complete -  Each Day can have as many pages as desired.
3. Not yet done~ can it even be done?
4. May not be possible yet.
