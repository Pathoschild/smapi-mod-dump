# Quality Fish Ponds

Quality Fish Ponds is a mod to keep the quality of the fish you place on Fish Ponds. Also there is a chance to get quality fish when fish multiply.

## Info
When you place the fish on the Fish Pond the quality of the fish will be recorded, so when you fish it again it will be on the same quality. If you have multiple fish on the pond, the fish will be random.\
Every time the fish multiply there is 1/3 to be Common quality, 1/3 of Silver quality and 1/3 of Gold quality. 
If you have the Angler fishing profession there is a chance of Iridium quality, the formula is:\
``(nº of Iridium quality on the pond * Luck level/10) / (2 * nº of fish on the pond)``
