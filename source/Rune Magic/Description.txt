[color=red][b][size=4][center]WARNING
This mod is in ALPHA, every feature is fully functional but there will be bugs. I will try to fix problems as they appear.
Please back up your save file if you use it with other mods!

[color=yellow][b][size=4][center]Big Update
Another Big Update, Implemented a lot of spells and fixed some more bugs.
Next up is the professions and the rest of the spells.

Sadly the only way is to remove all items which contain spells from the inventory or chests before updating. I'll try to look into a way to fix this in the future.
Also the summoning spell is incomplete right now, it will only summon a slime that follows the player.

The professions don't work yet, they are a priority for the next update.
Some of the spells are not working yet, you'll see the big NOT IMPLEMENTED on the description.

[center][size=5][b]How to Use[/b][/size][/center]

To start your journey, befriend the Wizard who will give you a staff and the basic recipes you will need to craft Runes and Scrolls (You need 3 hearts to trigger the event.)
After you get the Recipes, craft an Inscription Table or a Runic Anvil and start casting spells and level up.

[color=#00ff00][b][size=4]
Use R to cast and Q to activate Professions (You can bind the keys to whatever you want).

[center][size=5][b]Compatibility[/b][/size][/center]
[list][size=2]
[*][b]Other Mods: [/b]It should compatible with almost anything, even Magic from spacechace0, it would be redundant and not balanced though.
    Also I tested this with SVE and like 50 mods and haven't had any problems with it yet, but remember its ALPHA anything could happen.
[*][b]Multiplayer: [/b]Confirmed not working in multiplayer. I'll look into it when the mod is more complete.
[*][b]Mobile: [/b]This mod is made for PC only, and there are no plans to port it to mobile.

[size=5]Known Issues[/size]

[list][size=2]
[*]When creating runes using the Shift key to create 5 only the last one stays the others are erased, I don't know how to fix this. If anyone has an idea on how to limit the crafting to 1 rune it would be very welcome.

[b][size=4]Credits[/size][/b]


[size=3]This mod was possible thanks to [b]spacechase0[/b] as it is inspired in Magic, and uses SpaceCore, JsonAssets and Generic Mod Config Menu.
And of course to [b]pathoschild[/b], without SMAPI I wouldn't even know where to start.
