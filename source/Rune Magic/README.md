Rune Magic



WARNING

This mod is in ALPHA, every feature is fully functional but there will be bugs. I will try to fix problems as they appear.
Please back up your save file if you use it with other mods!



Features﻿﻿
Spells: A list of spells the player can use for various purposes. The spells can be learned and inscribed into magic items.
Every spell belongs to a school of magic. There are plans to add skills for every school in the future.
Magic Items:
Runes: Carved stone pieces with glyphs and Magic Dust that have charges. When activated, a spell is cast and a charge is used. They slowly recharge over time and have a random number of charges based on the level of the spell.
Scrolls: One-time use items that can be crafted and infused with spells. They don't have charges but are cheaper than runes.
Staves: Blunt weapons that grant the ability to cast spells. They always have 20 charges and regenerate once per day. They cannot be crafted but can be found in the mines.
Magic Skill: A skill to level that grants casting speed and new spell recipes for every level. It's currently the main way to acquire new spells.
Magic Professions: Professions for the Magic Skill, including Runesmith, Rune Master, and Rune Lord for the Rune side of the tree, and Scribe, Sage, and Lorekeeper for the Scrolls. Every profession has a way to make its chosen type of Magic Item more powerful, but you will always be able to use every item even if you chose another path.

How to Use

To start your journey, befriend the Wizard who will give you a staff and the basic recipes you will need to craft Runes and Scrolls (You need 3 hearts to trigger the event.)
After you get the Recipes, craft an Inscription Table or a Runic Anvil and start casting spells and level up.


Use R to cast and Q to activate Rune Master ability.





Compatibility

Multiplayer: This mod has not been tested in multiplayer. I have no friends.
Mobile: This mod is made for PC only, and there are no plans to port it to mobile.
Other Mods: It should compatible with almost anything, even Magic from spacechace0, it would be redundant and not balanced though.
Also I tested this with SVE and like 50 mods and haven't had any problems with it yet, but remember its ALPHA anything could happen.

Known Issues
When creating runes using the Shift key to create 5 only the last one stays the others are erased,  I don't know how to fix this. If anyone has an idea on how to limit the crafting to 1 rune it would be very welcome.



Credits

This mod was possible thanks to spacechase0 as it is inspired in Magic, and uses SpaceCore and JsonAssets.
And of course to pathoschild, without SMAPI I wouldn't even know where to start.
