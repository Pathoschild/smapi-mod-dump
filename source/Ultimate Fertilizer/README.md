# Ultimate Fertilizer

A Stardew Valley mod that modify aspects of fertilizers in a configurable way.

This is basically a combination of Fertilizer Anytime and MultiFertilizer, 
since they all are mods that are not yet updated for 1.6, and I want to use them, 
and they don't work together, so I decided to just write my own mod. 
Although the functionality are the similar, all code are written from scratch, 
mostly because their source code are neither efficient nor clean, 
and it would take less time to just write it myself than reading a transpiler.

# Features
* Everything is configurable
* Allow you to apply multiple types of fertilizer to a crop space.
* Allow you to choose what happen when you apply multiple same type of fertilizer to a crop space.
* Allows you to apply all fertilizer to a crop space that already has crops on it.
* Allow you to modify bonus value of each fertilizer.
* Allow you to modify amount per craft.
* Allow speed fertilizer to work with multi-phase crops.
* Keep fertilizer across season
