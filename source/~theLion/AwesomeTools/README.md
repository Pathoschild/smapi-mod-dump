## Features

This mod is inspired by the tools progression system of old Harvest Moon: Friends of Mineral Town, where the Axe and Hammer tools were also chargeable, and their ultimate upgrades destroyed all debris on-screen.

The mod is fully modular.

The shape of the shockwave is equivalent to a bomb explosion, but you can configure the radius for each of the four upgrade levels (in order: copper, steel, gold and iridium). These values must all be positive (obviously).

By default, the maximum radius is equal to the tool's upgrade level. The shockwave is set to only clear debris (like stones and twigs), weeds, dead crops and resource clumps (like stumps, logs and boulders), as well as mining nodes. Trees, live crops and placed objects will be unaffected. You are free to change these settings and choose which terrain features and objects you would like to be affected by the shockwave (though you can't do anything the Axe or Pickaxe can't ordinarily do).

Should be compatible and unaffected by tool enchants.

## Configs

This section describes the configurable settings provided in configs.json:

- **'RequiredUpgradeLevelForCharging':** This is the minimum upgrade level your tool must be at in order to enable charging. Accepted values are "Copper", "Steel", "Gold", "Iridium", "Radioactive" and "Mythicite" (the last two require Mood Misadventures).
- **'RadiusAtEachLevel':**  Allows you to specify a the shockwave radius at each charging level. Note that your charging level is separate from your upgrade level. For instance, if 'RequiredUpgradeLevelForCharging' is set to Iridium, and 'RadiusAtEachLevel' set to [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ], then you will not be able to charge until the tool is Iridium level, but once it is, then your charging progression will be similar to the gif above (starting at 1, and increase by 1 until 4). If you wanted to skip charging up and instantly get the max radius, you could set all four values to the same number (and set 'ShowAffectedTiles' to false to avoid the overlay instantly appearing). Only accepts positive integers.
- **'RequireModKey':** Set to false if you want charging behavior to be the default when holding down the tool button. Set to true if you prefer the default tool spamming behavior.
- **'ModKey':** If 'RequireModKey' is true, you must hold this key in order to charge (default LeftShift). If you play with a gamepad controller you can set this to LeftTrigger or LeftShoulder. Check [here](https://stardewcommunitywiki.com/Modding:Player_Guide/Key_Bindings) for a list of available keybinds. You can set multiple comma-separated keys.
- **'HideAffectedTiles':** If enabled, will not display the green overlay showing the size of the shockwave.
- **'StaminaCostMultiplier':** By default, charging multiplies your tool's base stamina cost by the charging level. Use this multiplier to adjust the cost of the shockwave *only*. Set to zero to make it free (you will still lose stamina equal to the base tool cost). Accepts any real number greater than zero.
- **'TicksBetweenWaves':** The number of game ticks before the shockwave grows by 1 tile. Higher numbers cause the shockwave to travel slower. Setting this to 0 replicates the original behavior from older versions.
- Other settings are self explanatory. Use [Generic Mod Config Menu](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5098) if you need verbatim explanations.
