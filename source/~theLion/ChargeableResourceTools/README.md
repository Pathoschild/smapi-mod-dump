## Features

This mod is inspired by the tools progression system of old Harvest Moon: FoMT, where the ultimate tool upgrades would let you instantly destroy all debris on the current screen. With this mod, you will be able to charge your Axe and Pickaxe to unleash an area of effect shockwave.

The mod is fully modular.

By default, the maximum radius of affected tiles is equal to the tool's upgrade level. This can be configure for each of the four upgrade levels (in order: copper, steel, gold and iridium). The values must be positive (obviously) and can be set to zero to disable charging at a particular upgrade level. The circle shape itself uses the same algorithm as bomb explosions.

The shockwave will clear debris (like stones and twigs), weeds, dead crops and resource clumps (like stumps, logs and boulders), as well as mining nodes. Trees, live crops and placed objects will be unaffected by default, but you may also change these settings and choose which terrain features and objects should be affected by the shockwave (though you can't do anything the Axe or Pickaxe can't ordinarily do).

Should be compatible with all tool enchants.

## Configs

This section describes the configurable settings provided in configs.json:

- **'RequiredUpgradeLevelForCharging':** This is the minimum upgrade level your tool must be at in order to enable charging. Accepts integer values (0 -> Base; 1 -> Copper; 2 -> Steel; 3 -> Gold; 4 -> Iridium; 5 -> Prismatic or Radioactive, if you have either of those mods installed).
- **'RadiusAtEachLevel':** Allows you to specify a custom radius for the shockwave at each *charging* level*.*Note that your charging level is separate from your upgrade level. For instance, if 'RequiredUpgradeLevelForCharging' set to **4**, and 'RadiusAtEachLevel' set to **[ 1, 2, 3, 4 ]**, then** **you will not be able to charge until the tool is Iridium level, but once it is, then your charging progression will be similar to the gif above (starting at 1, and increase by 1 until 4). If you wanted to skip charging up and instantly get the max radius, you could set all four values to the same number (and set 'ShowAffectedTiles' to false to avoid the overlay instantly appearing). If you have Prismatic or Radioactive Tools mod installed, a fifth value will be added automatically to the list. Only natural numbers (non-negative integers) are accepted.
- **'RequireModKey':** Set to false if you want charging behavior to be the default when holding down the tool button. Set to true if you prefer the default tool spamming behavior.
- **'ModKey':** If 'RequireModKey' is true, you must hold this key in order to charge (default LeftShift). If you play with a gamepad controller you can set this to LeftTrigger or LeftShoulder. Check [here](https://stardewcommunitywiki.com/Modding:Player_Guide/Key_Bindings) for a list of available keybinds. You can set multiple comma-separated keys.
- **'StaminaCostMultiplier':** By default, charging multiplies your tool's base stamina cost by the charging level. Use this multiplier to adjust the cost of the shockwave *only*. Set to zero to make it free (you will still lose stamina equal to the base tool cost). Accepts any real number greater than zero.
- Other settings are self explanatory. Use [Generic Mod Config Menu](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5098) if you need verbatim explanations.

## Compatibility

This mod uses Harmony to patch the behavior of Axe and Pickaxe. Any mods that also directly patch Tool behavior might be incompatible.
