Configurable Special Orders Unlock
by Vertigon

This mod seeks to make the Special Orders board more immediately accessible to the player. It does so by allowing the player (or host, if playing online) to modify
the date on which the Special Orders board is unlocked, and optionally whether or not to skip the corresponding cutscene.

Note: This mod has not been thoroughly tested for multiplayer use. Please report any issues you come across on the Nexus mod page.

If you have any issues:
Make sure SMAPI is up-to-date.
Make sure GMCM is up-to-date if you are using it.
Make sure you do not have any other mods installed which modify the Special Orders board installation cutscene (occurs on Fall 2 of Year 1 in Town).
You can reach me on the Stardew Valley discord (Vertigon#1851) or on the Nexus mod page.
Please provide a SMAPI log so that I can assist you better.
