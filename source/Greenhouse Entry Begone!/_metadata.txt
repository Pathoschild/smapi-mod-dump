       RELEASE 1.2.0:
       Platform changed to 'Any CPU'.
       Moved expensive per-tick checks for enabled config options per building to a global list.
       Replaced constant shadow colour with a basic colour finder to support most sprite recolours.
       Fixed wonky logic for matching building names to config options.
