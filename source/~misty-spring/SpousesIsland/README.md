## For players
### Install
1. [Install the latest version of SMAPI](https://smapi.io/).
2. Install [this mod from Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/11037).
3. Install [Non Destructive NPCs](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5176) and [Custom NPC Exclusions](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/7089).
4. Run the game using SMAPI.

### Uninstall
Remove this mod from the game's 'Mods' folder (or, if placed in a sub-folder, remove it from that one).

### Compatibility
Works with Stardew Valley 1.5.5 on Linux/macOS/Windows. (Requires SMAPI 3.14)

The following mods are confirmed to be compatible:
* Child To NPC
* Free Love
* Stardew Valley Expanded
* Immersive spouses
* ContentPatcher mods

This mod only edits schedules on specific days (and uses unique dialogue keys), it should work with most mods.

## For custom spouses
See here: [Adding a mod spouse](https://github.com/misty-spring/SpousesIsland/blob/main/docs/custom_spouse.md)

### For more help

* If you're facing issues with the formatting
The [json parser](https://smapi.io/json) will tell you of any problem within the content pack. When asked for a JSON format, leave it as "None".

## Translations
If you'd like to contribute translating, you can send me the translation (either via nexusmods or as a pull request.) You can also post the translation on nexus as your own file.

## Known issues
Children only use player warps. I've worked around this on my mod's side, so they should be able to visit.
