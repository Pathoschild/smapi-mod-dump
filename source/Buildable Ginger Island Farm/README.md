## Install
- Install the latest version of [SMAPI](https://smapi.io).
- Download this mod and unzip it into `Stardew Valley/Mods`.
- Run the game using **SMAPI**.

## How to use
The next day, after unlocking the farmhouse on Ginger Island, you will be able to choose which farm you want to construct buildings on when opening either Robin's or the Wizard's construction menu. The Ginger Island farm now operates similarly to your main farm, allowing you to construct any type of building except cabins. This includes animal houses and special buildings such as obelisks, Junimo huts, etc.\
By default, construction in the slime area is disabled. You can enable it from the mod configuration menu ([GMCM](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5098)). Note that to relocate animals from one farm to another, you will need the [Relocate Farm Animals](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/20606) mod.

## Frequently Asked Questions
- **Can I use this mod on an existing save?**  
Yes, no problem at all.
- **Can I uninstall this mod without any issues?**  
Yes, but it is recommended to demolish all the buildings on Ginger Island farm before uninstalling the mod. Without the mod, the Ginger Island farm will no longer be active when you are not there, which could cause unexpected behavior.
