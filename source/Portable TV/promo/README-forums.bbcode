The Portable TV is a resource item that can be carried in your inventory. Its crafting recipe is available immediately and requires a Gold Bar, 2 Refined Quartz and a Battery Pack.

To use the TV on Linux, macOS or Windows, select it in your inventory and right-click in an open part of the world. You can press "R" on your keyboard (or another key that you configure; see below) to activate any Portable TV in your inventory.

To use the TV on Android, select it in your inventory and tap anywhere in the world. You can also configure the Virtual Keyboard mod to add an "R" button; tapping it will activate any Portable TV in your inventory.

The farmer will pick up the TV and turn it on, showing the familiar channel list. After you have viewed your chosen program, the farmer will turn off the TV and put it away. Just use it again to watch something else.

If you have installed Generic Mod Config Menu, you can access this mod's configuration by clicking the cogwheel button at the lower left corner of the Stardew Valley title screen and then choosing "Portable TV".

Otherwise, you can edit this mod's [icode]config.json[/icode] file. It will be created in the mod's main folder ([icode]Mods/PortableTV[/icode]) the first time you run the game with the mod installed. These options are available:

[*][icode]Animate[/icode]: Set this to [icode]false[/icode] to have the Portable TV appear and disappear instantly from the screen.
[*][icode]Static[/icode]: Set this to [icode]false[/icode] to remove the light static from the Portable TV screen.
[*][icode]Music[/icode]: Set this to [icode]false[/icode] to prevent the Portable TV from playing music tracks over the standard channels. (Custom channels should be configured through their own mods.)
[*][icode]ActivateKey[/icode]: Set this to any valid keybinding that will then activate a Portable TV in your inventory. [url=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Player_Guide/Key_Bindings#Available_bindings]See the list of keybindings here.[/url]
