Times can be ignored.
Left hand side and right hand side should never both contain a "No Overlap" rule

Example:

[Daily Screenshot] Setting limits on StartTime and EndTime for rule "Time Overlap Fixup 1300 to 1099"
[Daily Screenshot] Swapping StartTime and EndTime for rule "Time Overlap Fixup 1300 to 1099"
[Daily Screenshot] StartTime is now "1140" amd EmdTime is now "1300" for rule "Time Overlap Fixup 1300 to 1099"
[Daily Screenshot] Setting limits on StartTime and EndTime for rule "Time No Overlap Directory"
[Daily Screenshot] Swapping StartTime and EndTime for rule "Time No Overlap Directory"
[Daily Screenshot] StartTime is now "1140" amd EmdTime is now "1300" for rule "Time No Overlap Directory"
[Daily Screenshot] Rules "Time No Overlap Morning" and "Time Overlap Fixup 1300 to 1099" can over write one another.
[Daily Screenshot] Rules "Location No Overlap Afternoon" and "Time Overlap Fixup 1300 to 1099" can over write one another.
