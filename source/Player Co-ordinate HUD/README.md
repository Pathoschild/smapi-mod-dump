## Player Co-ordinates Mod for Stardew Valley
All releases can be found on my [Nexus page](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/users/79440738). That is the only *official* place to find them.


This mod currently does two very simple things:
* It draws either your player, or cursor co-ordinates to the HUD in the top-left of the screen (this will be configurable at some point)
* It can log your player or cursor co-ordinates to a file (currently \<StardewDirectory\>/Mods/PlayerCoordinates/coordinate_output.txt)

Everything has a keybind in the mod's config.json file. Toggling the HUD, switching between player/cursor tracking, and finally, a bind to log the currently tracked co-ordinates to a file.
