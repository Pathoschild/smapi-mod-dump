# Easier Special Orders #

Have you ever had all the resources needed to complete a special order... Then realise you need to collect them after the order is accepted? 

This mod fixes that. The mod removes the collecting objective from all vanilla special orders, except Robin's Resource Rush (because collecting is all that order is)

The mod also allows many of Qi's challenges to have their difficulty toned down using the config that will generate after the game is run once with the mod installed, these are all disabled by default

Note: To work in multiplayer, all players need the mod installed and the config settings need to be the same


### The config settings: ###
