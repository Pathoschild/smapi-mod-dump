# AchtuurCore

Core mod required for most of my other mods, available on [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/16827).

## Events included (interface wip)

* `EventPublisher.onFinishedWateringSoil` - Fired when a player waters a tile of previously unwatered(!!) soil.

<!-- ### (unreleased) Changes made:

* WateringPatcher now uses pass-through prefix method (thanks to Shockah)
* Removed leftover watering debug message -->
