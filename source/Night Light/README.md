# NightLight
This Stardew Valley mod allows the player to view the valley as if it were daytime at all times. Also removed the darkness from the mines, which is most notable on floors 30-39 of the regular mines.

## Requirements:
- Stardew Valley 1.6+
- [SMAPI 4.0.0+](https://smapi.io/)

## Optional:
- [Generic Mod Configuration Menu](http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5098)
  - You can use the mod without, but you will have to manually edit the config.json file if so.
