# The Fish Dimension

A small, silly mod for Stardew Valley that forces every randomly-generated Help
Wanted quest to be about fish.

![A collage of Help Wanted requests, all of which are requesting that the
player catch or deliver fish.](only_fish.png)

## How it Works

Any generated quest that isn't a `FishingQuest` or an `ItemDeliveryQuest` will
be reassigned to one of those types (in the same proportion that they are
generated by default, about 1:4). All `ItemDeliveryQuest` will choose randomly
from available fish instead of whatever rules they might normally follow.

The fish selection for `FishingQuest` is not changed, but for
`ItemDeliveryQuest`, the new code makes extensive use of context tags, so
modded fish should work out of the box if they are tagged correctly. Here's
what is checked on the entries in `Data/Objects`:

- must be in the fish category (-4, i.e. actual fish)
- must have the tag `season_<current season>` OR `season_all`
- must not have the tag `fish_mines`
- must not have the tag `fish_legendary`
- if the bus is not repaired, must not have the tag `fish_desert`
- if no player has the dark talisman, must not have the tags `fish_bug_lair`
   or `fish_swamp`
- if ginger island is not accessible, must not have the tag `fish_ginger_island`

In order to make the last condition correctly exclude the ginger island fish,
this mod also adds the `fish_ginger_island` context tag to the three vanilla
ginger island fish.
