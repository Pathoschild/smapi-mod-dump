Ever wondered why there aren't any profession overhaul mods on the Nexus? Me too.


## Features

Profession-related features:
- Rebalanced and reworked [almost] every profession to be an equally unique and attractive choice.
- Each profession targets a specific style of gameplay, some which were not viable in vanilla (e.g. ranching).
- No more ~~boring~~ uninspiring +X% sell price bonuses.
- Bomberman mining; Thief/Assassin combat; epic slingshots; command an army of giant Slimes.
- Scaling end-game objectives.
- Level 5 professions provide simple early-game buffs that benefit most styles of general gameplay.
- Level 10 professions are more specialized and engaging, providing two bonuses which change the way you play.
- Professions are more consistent across the board, with several analogous perks and synergies.
- _[Optional]_ Lore-friendly multi-profession.
- _[Optional]_ Level 20 skills and prestiged professions.
- Gender-specific profession title.
- New icons for most professions, courtesy of [IllogicalMoodSwing](https://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/user/38784845-illogicalmoodswing/) (please make sure to [endorse their original](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/4163) mod).
- New sound effects and visuals for certain professions.
- HUD elements compatible with SVE's Galdora and [Vintage Interface v2﻿](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/4697).

Skill-related features:
- Combat levels which reward a profession (multiples of 5) now also reward 5 HP. At level 10 the player will have 200 health instead of 190.

Other balancing features:
- Meads take after the honey type. Matching [BAGI](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2080) ﻿icons are provided for vanilla flowers.
- _[Optional]_ Rebalanced Forges:
    - Jade: +10% -> +50% crit. power per level.
    - Topaz: +1 -> +5 defense per level.
    - Features intended to balance the new Brute and Poacher professions.
- _[Optional]_ Rebalanced Rings:
    - Jade: +10% -> +30% crit. power.
    - Topaz: nothing -> +3 defense, for consistency with enchantment.
    - Crab: +5 defense -> +8 defense, to distinguish from topaz.
    - Features intended to balance the new Brute and Poacher professions.

Integration is provided for Automate and several popular mods. See the [compatibility](#compatibility) section for details.

## Professions

### ![](https://i.imgur.com/p9QdB6L.png) Farming

- **Lv5 - Harvester** - 10% *(20%)* chance for extra yield from harvested crops.
    - Yields an equivalent 10% monetary bonus to vanilla on average, while also benefiting anybody who will not sell raw crops.
- **Lv10 - Agriculturist** - Crops grow 10% *(20%)* faster. Grow best-quality crops organically without fertilizer.
    - Allows harvesting of iridium-quality crops without any fertilizer. The chance is unchanged from vanilla, and is equal to half the chance of gold quality. Fertilizers will still massively increase that chance.
- **Lv10 - Artisan** - All artisan machines work 10% *(25%)* faster. Machine output quality is at least as good as input ingredient quality.
    - Essentially implements [Quality Artisan Products](https://www.moddrop.com/stardew-valley/mods/707502-quality-artisan-products) (QAP), but exclusively for Artisans. Also adds 5% chance to promote the output quality by one level. In multiplayer, **the bonus production speed applies only to machines crafted by the player with this profession, and only when that player uses the machine**.
- **Lv5 - Rancher** - Befriend animals 2× *(3×)* quicker.

- **Lv10 - Producer** - Happy animals produce 2× *(3×)* as frequently. Produce worth 5% more for every full barn or coop.
    - Note that happiness (mood) is **not** the same as friendship. Also note this will **not** allow certain animals (i.e. cows and chickens) to produce more than once per day. Bonus produce value also applies to artisan goods derived from animal products (i.e. cheeses, mayos and cloth), honey (bees are animals), and meat (Animal Husbandry or Fresh Meat). Only deluxe buildings can be considered full. **Note that honey is also considered an animal product.** There is no limit to the scaling. In multiplayer, **the bonus applies only to barns and coops owned by the player with this profession, and only when that player sells the produce**.

### ![](https://i.imgur.com/jf88nPt.png) Foraging

- **Lv5 - Forager** - 20% *(40%)* chance for double yield of foraged items.
    - _Unchanged effect from vanilla. Only the name is changed._
- **Lv10 - Ecologist** - Wild berries restore 50% *(100%)* more health and energy. Progressively identify forage of higher quality.

- **Lv10 - Scavenger** - Location of foragable items revealed. Occasionally detect buried treasure. *Time freezes during Scavenger Hunts.*
    - On switching maps while outside you will occasionally detect hidden buried treasure. Find it and dig it up (with a hoe) within the time limit to obtain your reward. The larger your win streak the better your odds of obtaining rare items.

    - _Unchanged effect from vanilla. Only the name is changed._
- **Lv10 - Arborist** - All trees grow faster. Normal trees can drop *(twice as much)* hardwood.
    - Bonus tree growth works as a global buff; i.e. in multiplayer, all trees will be affected as long as any player in the session has this profession, and the effect will stack for all additional online players that share this profession. _The hardwood bonus is unchanged from vanilla._
- **Lv10 - Tapper** - Tappers are cheaper to craft. Tapped trees give syrup 25% *(50%)* faster.
    - New regular recipe: x25 wood, x1 copper bar.

    - Analogous to Scavenger. Tracks any mining nodes or mineral forages off-screen with a yellow pointer, and any ladders or shafts with a green pointer. On entering a new mine floor you will occasionally detect stones with prospective treasure. Find the stone and break it within the time limit to obtain a reward. The larger your win streak the better your odds of obtaining rare items. Completing a hunt automatically reveals a ladder.
    - _Bonus: holding [ModKey](#configs) will highlight all nodes and ladders on-screen._
- **Lv5 - Blaster** - Craft twice as many explosives. Exploded rocks yield 2× *(3×)* as much coal.
- **Lv10 - Demolitionist** - Bomb radius +1. Exploded rocks yield 20% *(40%)* more resources.
    - _Bonus: [Get excited!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nlJuwO0GDs) when hit by an explosion._
- **Lv10 - Gemologist** - Progressively identify gems and minerals of higher quality. Crystalariums work 25% *(50%)* faster.
    - Analogous to Ecologist. All gems and minerals mined from nodes have a fixed quality, starting at silver and increasing once enough minerals have been collected. Minerals collected from Crystalariums and Geode Crushers are counted for this total, **but not those from geodes broken at Clint's**. In multiplayer, **the bonus Crystalarium speed applies only to machines crafted by the player with this profession, and only when used by that player**.

### ![](https://i.imgur.com/XvdVsAn.png) Fishing

- **Lv5 - Fisher** - Fish bite faster *(instantly)*. Live bait reduces the chance to fish junk.
    - Here, "junk" includes algae and seaweed.

    - *Legendary fish and extended family can be raised in the same pond.*
- **Lv5 - Trapper** - Crab pots are cheaper to craft. Can trap higher-quality *(highest-quality)* haul.
    - All trapped fish can have quality up to gold. Chance depends on your fishing level (same formula as forage). _Recipe is unchanged from vanilla._
- **Lv10 - Luremaster** - Crab pots no longer produce junk. Use different baits to attract different catch. *60% chance to preserve bait.*

        - **Wild bait:** 25% chance to also double the haul.
        - **Magnet:** Repels all fish (as per its description), but attracts metal items such as resources, artifacts, treasure chests, rings and even weapons.
        - **Magic bait:** 25% chance to catch fish of any location or season. Also upgrades all catch to iridium-quality.
- **Lv10 - Conservationist** - Crab pots without bait can trap junk. Clean the Valley's waters to merit tax deductions. *Cleaning the Valley's waters also merits favor with the villagers.*
    - Every 100 (configurable) junk items collected will earn you a 1% tax deduction the following season (max 25%, also configurable), increasing the value of all shipped goods. You will receive a formal mail from the Ferngill Revenue Service each season informing your currrent tax bracket.

### ![](https://i.imgur.com/fUnZSTj.png) Combat

    - _Unchanged from vanilla._
- **Lv10 - Brute** - Taking damage builds rage, improving combat prowess. +25 HP. *Rage also grants attack speed.*

    - In vanilla, slingshot projectiles have a short "grace period" during which it will ignore collision with enemies. This mod removes that grace period, allowing projectiles to hit enemies immediately in front of the Farmer. All professions are affected.
    -_Bonus: holding [ModKey](#configs) will fire a trick shot, which is weaker but can ricochet once. If prestiged, trick shots stun enemies for 5s._
- **Lv10 - Desperado** - Charge slingshot 50% faster. Can overcharge slingshots for more power, or quick-release for a double-shot. *Overcharged shots become spreadshots.*

    - **Quick-shots:** Release the shot as soon as it completes charging to perform double-shots.
    - **Spreadhots:** Fire three projectiles in a cone. Requires overcharging at least half the bar. The higher the bar the narrower the cone. 
- **Lv10 - Slimed Piper** - Attract more Slimes in dangerous areas. Chance to gain a random buff when a Slime is defeated. *Chance to also recover some health and energy when a Slime is defeated.*

    - Buffs are the same as food/drink buffs (skill levels, attack, defense, speed, luck, max energy, magnetism). Lasts 5 minutes and stacks indefinitely, refreshing the duration each time.
    - _Bonus: immune to the Slimed debuff, even without a Slime Charmer ring._

## Prestige

The [Statue of Uncertainty](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/The_Sewers#Statue%20Of%20Uncertainty) has been replaced by the Statue of Prestige, which is capable of resetting level 10 skills, for a price. A skill reset preserves all related professions, and (optionally) forgets all related recipes. The farmer can use this to eventually acquire all 30 professions simultaneously.
Resetting a skill costs 10,000g the first time, 50,000g the second time, and 100,000g the last time (values are configurable). The ribbon in the skills page of the game menu reflects the number of professions acquired in each skill.

Once the ribbon has reached its fourth stage, signaling that all professions have been obtained, its level cap is raised to 20, allowing the farmer to continue developing tool proficiency or max health. Skill level also affects the odds of higher quality crops and fishes, the amount of berries foraged per bush, and the duration of Ultimate and related perks.
 
At levels 15 and 20, the farmer can choose a profession to prestige, improving one of its base perks, or, in some cases, granting entirely new ones. These choices can later be changed at the Statue of Prestige, for a cost.

All Prestige features are optional and may be disabled or customized in the configs. Non-vanilla skills at the moment are not supported by prestige.

## Ultimates

Each level 10 Combat profession is also granted an Ultimate ability. This ability must be charged by performing certain actions during combat. The current charge state is revealed by a new HUD bar next to health. The player can only have a single Ultimate ability registered at any time; i.e. acquiring all combat professions via skill resetting will not grant additional Ultimates beyond the first. The overnight level-up menu will prompt the player if they wish to replace their current Ultimate ability with the new professions'.

- **Brute / Amazon - Undying Frenzy** - Doubles rage accumulation for 15s. Immune to passing out. When the effect ends, recovers 5% health for every enemy slain while the buff was active.
    - Charged by taking damage or defeating enemies. Charges more quickly if wielding a blunt weapon.
- **Bushwhacker - Ambuscade** - Become invisible and untargetable for 30s. Effect ends prematurely if the player attacks an enemy. When the effect ends, gain a 2x crit. power buff that lasts for twice the leftover invisibility duration.
    - Charged by scoring critical hits. Consider wielding a dagger.
- **Desperado - Death Blossom** - Enable auto-reload for 15s. Fire in eight directions at once.
  - Journey of the Prairie King, "IRL".
  - Charged by hitting monsters with projectiles. Charges more quickly when low on health.
- **Slimed Piper / Slime Enchantress - Pandemonia** - Charm nearby Slimes for 30s. Charmed Slimes increase in size and power and will seek out other enemies. Enemies hit will aggro onto the Slime.
  - Slimes scale up factor is random, up to twice the original size. Slimes gain a proportional damage and health boost.
  - If defeated, engorged Slimes break up into smaller baby Slimes.
  - There is also a low chance to convert Slimes to a special variant. If "Prismatic Jelly" special order is active, low chance to convert the Slime to prismatic variant.
  - Nearby Big Slimes explode immediately.
  - Charged by being touched by Slimes, or by defeating Slimes and Big Slimes.


Once all 30 professions have been acquired, the Statue of Prestige may be used to switch Ultimates at will.

Ultimates can be disabled via a config setting if desired.

- [All Professions](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/174) (use included prestige or console commands instead).

## Configs

While the vast majority of professions bonuses are non-configurable, some of the more radical changes have been given configuration options to give the user some degree of control. As such the mod provides the following config options, which can be modified either in-game via Generic Mod Config Menu or by manually editing the configs.json file:

### General Configs
- **Modkey** (keybind) - The Prospector and Scavenger professions use this key to reveal the locations of key objects currently on the screen. If playing on a large screen with wide field of view, this can help locate foragables of mine nodes in large or busy maps. The default key is LeftShift for keyboards and LeftShoulder for controllers.
- **UseVintageSkillBars** (bool) - Set to true if you use the Vintage Interface﻿ mod. Makes the skill bars above level 10 a light pink. You can use this with the brown version of Vintage Interface. If you want to use the pink version you will have to recolor the file `assets/menus/skillbars_vintage.png` by yourself.

Note that this only affects that chance the game will try to start a treasure hunt, and the actual chance is slightly lower as the game might fail to choose a valid treasure tile. Increase this value if you don't see enough treasure hunts, or decrease it if you find treasure hunts cumbersome and don't want to lose your streak. Default is 0.2 (20%).
- **AllowScavengerHuntsOnFarm** (bool) - Whether a Scavenger Hunt can trigger while entering a farm map.

### Ultimate Configs
- **EnableUltimate** (bool) - Required to allow Ultimate activation.
- **UltimateKey** (keybind) - This is the key that activates Ultimate for 2nd-tier combat professions. By default this is the same key as Modkey, but can also be set to a different key.

## API

The mod exposes an API to facilitate integration with other mods. Currently exposed endpoints include:

- Checking the current quality of Ecologist forage or Gemologist minerals.
- Checking the current tax deduction bracket for Conservationist.
- Forcing new Treasure Hunt events, or interrupting active Treasure Hunts.
- Subscribing callbacks to Treasure Hunt started or ended events.
- Checking a player's registered Ultimate ability.
- Subscribeing callbacks to Ultimate charging, activation and deactivation events.
- Checking whether the Ultimate meter is currently being displayed (useful for UI mods to decide whether to reposition their own HUD elements).
- Checking the player's config settings for this mod.

To consume the API, copy both interfaces from the [Common.Integrations](../Common/Integrations/ImmersiveProfessions) namespace to your project and [ask SMAPI for a proxy](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Modder_Guide/APIs/Integrations).
