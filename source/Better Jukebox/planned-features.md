# Planned features

* ADDED - Config option to allow selection from all songs instead of just those previously heard
* ADDED - Buttons to sort the list (alphabetical, heard order (default), Bandcamp (e: kinda combined with Steam) ordering)
* ADDED - Keyboard and (hypothetical) controller support
* Possible support for [audio addition/replacement mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/categories/12/)
* May be better suited for a different mod (most probably require Harmony):
  * Allow music to play in the rain
  * Allow mini-jukebox operation anywhere (instead of just the farm)
  * [KINDA EXISTS](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/7936) - Open the jukebox menu at any point (like a portable music player)
  * Creation of playlists and associated features ()
  * [EXISTS](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/7936) - Literally just a sound test (could be a seperate tab on the jukebox, or a main menu option - or both!)
