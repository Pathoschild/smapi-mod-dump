**Better Jukebox** is a [Stardew Valley](http://stardewvalley.net/) mod that redesigns the menu
that pops up when you use either the jukebox in the Saloon or a Mini-Jukebox.

## Install
1. [Install the latest version of SMAPI](https://smapi.io/).
2. Install [this mod from Nexus mods](http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/6017).
3. Run the game using SMAPI.

## Configure
The mod creates a `config.json` file in its mod folder the first time you run it. You can open that
file in a text editor to configure the mod.

These are the available settings:

| setting				| what it does
| ---					| --- 
| `ShowInternalID`		| Default `false`. Shows the internal reference for music tracks next to the actual name.
| `ShowAmbientTracks`	| Default `false`. Shows the ambient and other non-musical tracks normally hidden from the player.
