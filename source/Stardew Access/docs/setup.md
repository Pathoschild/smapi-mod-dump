2. Download Accessible Stardew Setup (ASS). [get ASS here](https://github.com/ParadoxiKat/AccessibleStardewSetup/releases/latest)

## Manual Installation

If you prefer to install SMAPI, Stardew Access, and its dependencies manually, you may follow the instructions below.

### Requirements

1. [SMAPI](#smapi-setup)
2. [Kokoro](#installing-kokoro-and-project-fluent)
3. [Project Fluent](#installing-kokoro-and-project-fluent)

### SMAPI setup

#### Windows

**Important Note:** If you are launching the game from the Xbox app, proceed to [Xbox App Setup](#xbox-app-setup), otherwise proceed with the instructions below.

1. Run Stardew Valley at least once before attempting to install anything.
2. Download the [latest version of SMAPI](https://smapi.io/).
3. Extract the .zip file somewhere. (Your downloads folder is fine).
4. Open the new folder once it has finished unzipping. You may need to open two folders to get to the contents.
4. Double-click `install on Windows.bat`, and follow the on-screen instructions.

##### Xbox App Setup

**Before installing SMAPI:**

1. Make sure you have Run Stardew Valley at least once.
2. Open the Stardew Valley section in the Xbox app.
3. Click the `3 dots button` (should be next to the share button) then `Manage button`
4. Click the `Files tab` and then `Browse button` to open your game folder
5. Open the Stardew Valley > Content folder. You should see a lot of files with names like api-ms-win-core-\*
6. Copy the full path from the address bar, located visually at the top of Windows Explorer or by pressing `alt + d` to move cursor focus there.
7. Download the [latest version of SMAPI](https://smapi.io/).
8. Extract the .zip file anywhere that is *not* your game installation directory, such as your downloads folder.
9. Open the newly-extracted folder once it has finished unzipping. You may need to open two folders to get to the contents.
10. Double-click `install on Windows.bat`.
11. When the installer asks where you want to add or remove SMAPI, type "2" to enter a custom game path.
12. enter the custom file path you copied in step 6. CMD allows `Ctrl V` to paste.

**After installing SMAPI:**

In your game installation directory:

1. rename `Stardew Valley.exe` to another name such as `Stardew Valley original.exe`.
2. make a copy of `StardewModdingAPI.exe` and name the copy `Stardew Valley.exe`.
3. Launch the game through the Xbox app to play with mods.

**Important Note:** You must reinstall SMAPI and rename the .exe files each time there is a SMAPI update.

##### Integrating with Your Game Client

While this step is optional, it will allow you to use the normal shortcuts to launch Stardew Valley and enable cheats.
If you do not complete this step, you must launch Stardew Valley via `StardewModdingAPI.exe` for all mods to function. Using the shortcut created by the game installation will not load SMAPI or any mods.

#### Installing Kokoro and Project Fluent

As of v1.5.0, [Kokoro](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/15682) and [Project Fluent ](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/12638) are now dependencies for
Stardew access and as such, the mod won't run without
them.
Project Fluent is used for providing better translations for Stardew access and also the ability to
use [Mozilla's project fluent](https://projectfluent.org/) instead of regular json for translation files.
Kokoro is a core mod for many of [Shockah's](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/users/133612513) mods and is required for Project Fluent to work.

Installation of Project Fluent and Kokoro is essentially the same as installing any other mod, here are the steps:

1. Download the v1.1.0 of Project Fluent
   from [this Nexus direct link](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/12638?tab=files&file_id=56519) ([login](https://users.nexusmods.com/auth/sign_in)
   if you haven't already) or
   from [Github](https://github.com/Shockah/Stardew-Valley-Mods/releases/download/release%2Fproject-fluent%2F1.1.0/ProjectFluent.1.1.0.zip).
    - Do note that the Github link is only temporary and might get removed in future as the owner only publishes mod
      updates to Nexus.
2. Download the v3.0.0 of Kokoro from
   [this Nexus direct link](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/15682?tab=files&file_id=82817)
3. Extract both zip files and move the contents of each into the `Mods` folder in your game's folder.

### Updating Stardew Access

To update Stardew Access:

1. Delete the Stardew Access mod from the game installation's mods directory.
2. Reinstall Stardew Access according to the instructions above.
