# Introduction

Stardew Access is a [Stardew Valley](https://stardewvalley.net/) mod that focuses on making the game blind accessible for windows, linux and mac.
The mod uses the [Tolk](https://github.com/ndarilek/tolk) library on windows, [libspeechdwrapper](https://github.com/khanshoaib3/libspeechdwrapper) on linux and [libspeak](https://github.com/Flameborn/libspeak) on mac for interacting with the active screen reader.
The mod adds several features to help the player gather information regarding the surrounding and the player.
It also patches the various menus and the fishing mini-game (more mini-games will be patched soon) to make them accessible.

If you are a mod developer and want to integrate your mod with stardew access then checkout the [wiki page](https://github.com/khanshoaib3/stardew-access/wiki).
