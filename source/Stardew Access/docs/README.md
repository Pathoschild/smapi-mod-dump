# Stardew Access

Stardew Access is a [Stardew Valley](https://stardewvalley.net/) mod that focuses on making the game accessible to blind screen reader users on Windows, Linux and Mac OS. It adds narration through the active screen reader to the game, the menus, the character dialogue, and more to give the player information about their farmer and the world around them.
Nearby objects, monsters, and favorite locations are only a few keystrokes away with the object tracker.
Planting, harvesting, construction, and mining are all made easy via narration of tiles and the tile reader.
To interact with the active screen reader, Stardew Access uses the [Tolk](https://github.com/ndarilek/tolk) library on windows, [libspeechdwrapper](https://github.com/khanshoaib3/libspeechdwrapper) on Linux, and [libspeak](https://github.com/Flameborn/libspeak) on Mac OS.
