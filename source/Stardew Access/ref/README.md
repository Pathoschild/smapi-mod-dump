## Reference Assemblies

(Thanks to [jag's](https://github.com/jag3dagster) [stardew mods repo](https://github.com/Hedgehog-Technologies/StardewMods/blob/main/src/ref/README.md)
that I used as a reference for generating the ref assemblies and the build workflow)

The assemblies in this directory were generated using [JetBrain's Refasmer Tool](https://github.com/JetBrains/Refasmer).

These files were only generated for me to be able to use them to auto-build the mod via github workflow.
As such, I do not claim to be as the owner or distributer of these files.

Please reach out to me in case you have any issues in having them in the public repo.
