# Dragon Pearl Lure

In honor of Lunar New Year 2023, this mod adds a new pearl lure item that the serpents in Skull Cavern will chase (instead of you, the player). This pearl is meant to represent the "Pearl of Wisdom" that dragon dancers chase at Chinese New Year parades. 

## How to Get the Pearl Lure
* It is sold at the Dwarf's shop for 900g.
* You can also buy the recipe at the Dwarf's shop when you reach level 7 mining for 5000g.

## How to Use the Pearl Lure
* Place it on the ground and it will act like a bomb (but with very low damage).
* It will spawn a flaming pearl monster that moves around the map.
* Serpents will chase the flaming pearl monster.

## Compatibility
* This mod should be compatible with most mods.
* Mods that modify monster movement may conflict.

Thank you to DecidedlyHuman for suggesting a less horrifying way to do the code, and CopperSun for prompting the mod idea!
