(ARTIFACT DIG SPOTS)
Artifact_AlreadyFoundMultiplier: 
	Should be between 0 and 1. Every time an artifact is found, its weight is multiplied by this number. 
	A smaller number results in less chance to find a duplicate artifact.
	0 makes duplicates impossible from the primary table. Set to 1 to disable this mechanic.
		
Artifact_BaseWeightForNothingInPrimaryTable: 
	Should be roughly between 0 and 0.1 . A higher number makes it more likely to not find an artifact.
	I recommend keeping this off (set to zero) as it makes finding any artifact much harder when you have found many artifacts.

Artifact_MultiplierForNothingInPrimaryTable: 
	Should be roughly between 0 and 10 . A higher number makes it more likely to not find an artifact.

(GEODES)
Geode_AlreadyFoundMultiplier: 
	Should be between 0 and 1. A smaller number means there is less chance for duplicates.
	Every time a mineral/artifact is found, its chance for being found again is multiplied by this number.
	Set to 0 to disable duplicates, or 1 to disable this mechanic.
