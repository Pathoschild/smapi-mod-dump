This update doesn't change much from the original, it primarily brings the mod up to date with Stardew Valley version 1.6.   
If I broke something, let me know by submitting a bug report or reaching on Discord (@chiccen). You are also free to contribute to the [Github](https://github.com/chiccenFL/FruitTreeTweaks/tree/main).  
If making a bug report on Nexus, please use the ["Bugs"](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/21449/?tab=bugs) tab and ***not*** "Posts" unless it is a suggestion, a mod conflict, or a very very minor bug.
