## Wild Tree Tweaks by chiccen


This mod aims to offer some functionality from [Fruit Tree Tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/21449/) to basic wild, non-fruit trees! 
If you experience issues, let me know by submitting a bug report or reaching on Discord (@chiccen). You are also free to contribute to the [Github](https://github.com/chiccenFL/StardewValleyMods/tree/main/WildTreeTweaks).
