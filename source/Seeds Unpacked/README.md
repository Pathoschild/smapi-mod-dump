If you've played Raft, Runescape, or one of any number of other games with fun little farming sidegames, then you've likely thought how cute their seeds are!  
This mini-mod simply replaces the appearance of seed packets to have them instead use their crops' seed sprites.

![](https://i.imgur.com/YB5hRuj.png) Works with (hopefully!) all custom crops and seeds.  
![](https://i.imgur.com/qMPwvr7.png) Trellises, starters, saplings, and bushes aren't changed, since their sprites would be too big to fit!
