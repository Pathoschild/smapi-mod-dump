## ZoomLevel
You can increase zoom level with ``, (comma)`` and decrease it with ``. (period)``.

By holding ``Left Shift`` or ``Right Shift`` and using the controls above, you can change the UI Scale.

If you use a controller, you can also adjust it by pressing the ``left stick`` to decrease the zoom and ``right stick`` to increases the zoom.
By holding ``Left Trigger & Right Trigger`` and using the controls above, you can change the UI Scale.
