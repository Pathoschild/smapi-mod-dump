# Not Far From The Tree
**Not Far From The Tree** (NFFTT) is a **[Stardew Valley](https://www.stardewvalley.net/)** mod that uses the [Stardew Modding API](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2400) to dynamically replace the default textures of Children to a texture that matches the appearance of the player marriage candidate.

In the future it may use more in-depth Sprite rendering to dynamically create a spritesheet that resembles the marriage candidate and the customizable player character.

- See the mod on [Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/4739/).
