Draw Fish Ponds Over Grass
=================================

![Header image](docs/header.png)

This mod causes the fish pond to be drawn over any grass placed under it.

## Install

1. Install the latest version of [SMAPI](https://smapi.io).
2. Download and install [AtraCore](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/12932).
2. Download this mod and unzip it into `Stardew Valley/Mods`.
3. Run the game using SMAPI.

## Compatibility

* Works with Stardew Valley 1.5.6 on Linux/macOS/Windows.
* Works in single player, multiplayer, and split-screen mode. Should be fine if installed for one player only.
* Should be compatible with most other mods. Does not, however, affect the layer depth fish wells draw at. Those will still probably be under grass.
