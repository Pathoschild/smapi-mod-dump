Changelog
==============

#### Todo
1. Document the tooltip override feature + how to replace the textures in Content Patcher.
2. Make sure all strings I want translated are complete, and ask for translations.

#### Known issues
* Controllers probably won't be able to lock onto the arrows properly, owing to the....nontraditional menu setup here. It's likely not something I can fix, either.
* I apply the chosen enchantment when forging, not before. So if you're using a predictor, it'll just show what the game would have picked. (This goes for Many Enchantment's debug logging as well.)

#### Version 1.1.0
* Update to using AtraCore (and associated internal improvements).

#### Version 1.0.5
* Added Chinese translation (thanks to [love1997](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/users/57631836)!)

#### Version 1.0.4
Updates to SMAPI 3.14.0. Internal optimizations.

#### Version 1.0.3
* Added Hungarian translations! (Thanks to [martin66789](https://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/user/27323031-martin66789/)!)
* Internal optimizations.

#### Version 1.0.2
* Fixes the check for duplicate enchantments.

#### Version 1.0.1
* Added tooltips: hover over the name of the enchantment to get a description. (You may need to find a certain journal scrap first.)
* Slightly adjust the menu for longer enchantment names in some languages. Fix issue where the enchantment names would not change if you switched languages.
* Made this mod's textures targetable in Content Patcher.
* Splitscreen fixes.

#### Version 1.0.0
* Initial upload.
