* Hides crab pots during festivals and events.

#### Version 1.0.7

* Just-in-case compatability adjustments for Smart Building - disables this mod's ability to place grass under things whenever Smart Building's build mode is on, which IMO makes it easier to place things anyways....

* Remove excess debugging statements accidentally left in. My apologies.

#### Version 1.0.5 : Rebrand to Atra's Interaction Tweaks

* Allows placement of grass under things.
* Bomb confirm: Bombs placed in "non dangerous" areas will ask for a confirmation first. Definitely safe areas: farm, greenhouse, town and Ginger Island farm. Definitely unsafe areas: mines, skull caverns, and volcano dungeon. Everywhere else is unsafe if there's a single monster on the map. (Configurable)
* Fix splitscreen issues.
* Clicking on a butterfly hutch spawns a butterfly.
* Jukeboxes can be placed anywhere.
* Config to allow coconuts to be dropped by palm trees off island.

* Makes the gate message less spammy.

#### Version 1.0.3

* Allows outdoor rugs.
* Gates no longer pop off when right click is held near them.

#### Version 1.0.2

* Catches ill-formed config files and asks users to use GMCM instead. Adds GMCM version check.
* Prevents accidental removal of items from tables as well.
