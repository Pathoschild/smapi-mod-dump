===========================

This is a Work-In-Progress.
<!--
## Install

1. Install the latest version of [SMAPI](https://smapi.io).
2. Download and install [AtraCore](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/12932).
2. Download this mod and unzip it into `Stardew Valley/Mods`.
3. Run the game using SMAPI.

## Uninstall
Simply delete from your Mods directory.

## Configuration
Run SMAPI at least once with this mod installed to generate the `config.json`, or use [Generic Mod Config Menu](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5098) to configure.


## Compatibility

* Works with Stardew Valley 1.5.6 on Linux/macOS/Windows.
* Works in single player, multiplayer, and split-screen mode. Should be fine if installed for only one player in multiplayer.
* Should be compatible with most other mods. Tested with [Producer Framework Mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/4970). Currently does not affect DGA machines; I'll add that in later.
