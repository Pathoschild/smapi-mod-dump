Critter Rings
=================================

![Header image](docs/image.png)

This incredibly self-indulgent mod has two rings in it. The Butterfly ring summons a butterfly every ten in-game minutes during daytime. The Firefly ring summons a firefly every ten in-game minutes during night. Additionally, the butterfly ring is a magnetic ring, and the firefly ring is a glow ring.

Buy both from Marlon after you've gotten the skull key.
