# **Let Me Rest**

In Stardew Valley we have many beautiful locations and decorations, but in the most of case we don't pay attention to that.<br/>
Let Me Rest exists to make that things important! Now the decoration and locations around the map makes the difference to your gameplay!<br/>

You can sit, ride a horse or just stand still to recover stamina, having many multipliers based on the decoration around you and the ambient that you are.<br/>

Each furniture had a different multiplier, based on the rarity, price and cuteness!<br/>
