// This is an example on how to format your mod's catalogue.json
{
	// You can make as many catalogues as you want in your mod
	// The key is the Id of the furniture you want to put your shop on
	// The value is the Id of the shop to put on the furniture
	"Example_Catalogue_Furniture": "Example_Catalogue_Shop"

	// The furniture and shop must be created using Content Patcher
	// For the furniture, see https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Items#Furniture
