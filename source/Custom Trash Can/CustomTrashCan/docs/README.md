# Custom Trash Can

Custom Trash Can allows you to configure/customize the item reclamation price for all levels of [Trash Cans](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Trash_Cans).

Edit config.json directly to go beyond 100% refund value. üòÅ

Or, modify it in game using [Generic Mod Config Menu](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5098).

This mod uses Harmony to patch the reclaimation price calculation in the game and is not compatible with the mods that do the same.
