# Secret Gardens
[(source)](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/3067)

A new greenhouse that makes it look like a garden. Still functions the same way as a greenhouse but now expanded.

## Features
- New greenhouse replacement that makes it look like a Secret Garden
- Works with old and new saves
- (4) 3x3 farm plots, (1) 15x15 farm plot and 12 tree spots
- A relaxing area with a computer that displays your farmer stats and a radio that lets you change the current music playing
- A cave area for storage or other stuff
- [ ]```[FUTURE RELEASE]```: A swimming lake

## Compatibility
- Tested with Stardew Valley 1.3.28, SMAPI 2.7 and Content Patcher 1.4 (should work with anything higher)
- Should work with both singleplayer and multiplayer. For multiplayer, everyone should have this mod installed or they won't see the new greenhouse

**KNOWN ISSUES**
- Will conflict with other mods that replace the greenhouse interior unless it is an XNB mod (my mod will override it)
- For old saves with stuff in the greenhouse, you would need to destroy/move things around but it shouldn't be too bad
