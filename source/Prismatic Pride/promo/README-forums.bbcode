When this mod is installed, all prismatic things in the game - clothing, Junimo and more - will cycle through the colors of one of the pride flags. This starts out with the 11 colors of the [b][url=https://quasar.digital/progress-initiative/]Progress Pride Flag[/url][/b] by default (configurable; see below).

To [b]change the pride flag[/b] whose colors are used, [b]press the [icode]U[/icode] key[/b] to bring up the menu (key configurable; see below). This menu works like the one for the Jukebox: use the arrows to cycle through the options; press the green play button to apply the option shown; and press the red "no" button to close the menu. See under Acknowledgments below for all the flags and their origins.

This mod adds [b]10 shirts and 5 pants[/b] to the game. Together with the [url=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Prismatic_Shard#Tailoring]prismatic clothing from the base game[/url] and the [url=https://forums.stardewvalley.net/index.php?resources/prismatic-skirts-dresses-for-content-patcher.44/]Prismatic Skirts and Dresses[/url] mod, this is a complete collection matching the base game's dyeable clothing collection. To [b][url=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Tailoring]tailor[/url] a random one[/b] of all these items, use one [b]Cloth and a Prismatic Shard[/b] at the sewing machine.

This mod also adds [b]Prismatic Boots[/b] which rotate through colors while worn, just like other prismatic items. To tailor an [b]existing pair[/b] into Prismatic Boots, use the boots (on the left) and a [b]Prismatic Shard[/b] (on the right) at the sewing machine. The machine will [b]preserve the stats[/b] from the existing pair.

If you have installed Shop Tile Framework, you can also [b]purchase specific items[/b] of prismatic clothing instead of leaving it up to chance. Interact with the [b]left side of Emily's fabric shelves[/b] (just to the right of the sewing machine) to bring up the [b]shop menu[/b]. On any given day, you will be able to choose from five prismatic shirts, five prismatic pants and the Prismatic Boots, including items from the base game, this mod and (if installed) Prismatic Skirts and Dresses. Each item [b]costs one Prismatic Shard[/b].
