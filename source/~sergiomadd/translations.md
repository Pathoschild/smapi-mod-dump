This page is for people that want to help translating my mods.

If you have never translated a mod, read [Translation guide](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Translations).

### How to translate:
1. Download the mod. 
2. Go into the i18n folder. Create a new .json file with you language prefix, or modify an existing one.
3. Do the trasnlation from the default.json file's text. Make sure to save it with UTF-8 encoding.
4. Create a Pull Request on this github page with your modifications.
5. Wait for the PR to be aproved.
You can ping me on discord (@sergiomadd#5168) or on twitter (@madded__) if you have one ready.
