Early Community Upgrades
by Vertigon

This mod seeks to make the Community Upgrades more accessible to the player. It does so by allowing the player (or host, if playing online) to modify:
 - the order in which Community Upgrades are offered,
 - the requirements for the Community Upgrades to be offered, and
 - the costs to purchase each upgrade.

Note: This mod has not been thoroughly tested for multiplayer use. Please report any issues you come across on the Nexus mod page.

If you have any issues:
Make sure SMAPI is up-to-date.
Make sure GMCM is up-to-date if you are using it.
Make sure you do not have any other mods install which modify Robin's dialogue menu.
You can reach me on the Stardew Valley discord (Vertigon#1851) or on the Nexus mod page.
Please provide a SMAPI log so that I can assist you better.
