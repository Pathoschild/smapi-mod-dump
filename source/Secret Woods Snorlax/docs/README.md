# Secret Woods Snorlax

Instead of a hollow log blocking your path into the Secret Woods, there's a
big, lazy creature sleeping there. It's Snorlax, the OG champion of sleeping in
inconvenient locations. How will you get past him?

(Do not use your axe. That is rude, and will not work.)

(Do not use a chair, either. I'll know.)

After you interact with him, the villagers will start giving you hints. These
clues should help you figure out how to trigger the event you need to get the
big oaf to move. You can try to work it out on your own (the requirements are
not very steep), or you can read these spoiler blocks:

Starting from the next day after interacting with Snorlax:
  
* Days 1&ndash;3: Shane, Abigail, Linus
* Days 4&ndash;6: Evelyn, Emily, Leah
* Days 7&ndash;9: Demetrius, Penny, Lewis
</details>

**The solution**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>
Earn a total of 20,000g and reach 2 hearts with the Wizard. Then enter his tower.
</details>

Only the main player can trigger the event (no farmhands).

After you've moved Snorlax, he'll stick around. He'll just be a few tiles over,
safely out of the way, so you can continue to hang out with him.

## Requirements

You will need the following dependencies:

* Stardew Valley 1.6
* SMAPI 4.0.0+

## Compatibility

Yes: Stardew Valley Expanded (now with fixed plot event!)

Yes: Stardew Valley Reimagined 3

Yes: Lunna Astray in Stardew Valley (no longer blocks entrance after moving)

Yes: Multiplayer (farmhands no longer crash when entering the forest. some, but
not all, animations are transmitted to other players)

Dubious: mods that alter the Secret Woods entrance

Most other things should be fine. This mod doesn't do a lot.

## Old Save Files

If you've already destroyed the log obstacle in your current save file, don't
worry! Snorlax will still be here for you. He'll simply be in the moved
position to start, ready to be your friend. No one will give you hints, since
they aren't needed. You will still be able to trigger the event (the dialogue
will change slightly).

If you load a 1.5.6 save in 1.6.0 or newer, and that save had the previous
releases of this mod installed, your previous key item will become an error
item. You should automatically receive a new one, after which it is safe to
trash the error item.

Similarly, it should be safe to delete this mod at any point. If you have the
key item, it will become an error item, but there should be no other side
effects.
