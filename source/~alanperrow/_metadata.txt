       Convenient Inventory 1.2.0 (#7)
       
       * Initial work for v1.2.0 release.
       
       * Create README.md
       
       * Update README.md
       
       * Fix assets directory issue due to capitalization.
       Add hotkey for quick stack via opt-in config option.
       
       * ModEntry "Context" => "Instance", so I can access SMAPI's Context class without it being confusing.
       Added context checks for OnButtonPressed events (favorite items hotkey, quick stack hotkey).
       
       * Fixed bug where GMCM "default" button would create a new ModConfig without having ModEntry.Config reference it (so any future config changes would not be saved).
       
       Changed default FavoriteItemsControllerHotkey to LeftShoulder.
       Changed default QuickStackControllerHotkey to LeftStick.
       
       These hotkeys make more sense, in my opinion. Will have to bring awareness to the keybind change when publishing.
       
       * Formatting
