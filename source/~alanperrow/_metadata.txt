       Convenient inventory 1.3.0 (#10)
       
       * Initial commit for 1.3.0
       
       * Implemented inventory page "side warp" for controllers to have quicker access to the right side of the menu (and back).
       
       * Added inventory page side-warp gif in README
       
       * Added "player_fixinventory" SMAPI console command
       
       * Implemented "ignore item quality when quick stacking" feature via opt-in config option IsQuickStackIgnoreItemQuality.
       Added to README documentation.
       
       * Added more functionality to inventory cursor warp. Now invisible drop button will have junimo note as its leftNeighbor if visible (otherwise organize button, same as before). All right-side buttons now have the invisible drop button as their rightNeighbor.
       
       * Draft commit for supporting content pack mods with custom chests. Will undo this in the next commit - just want a history trail in case this is revisited in the future.
       
       * Removed draft commit changes regarding supporting content pack mods with custom chests.
       Abstracted direct references to TypedChest as ITypedChest, for easier implementation in the possible future.
       
       * Fixed: New house packages (presents) should not be considered for quick stack.
       
       * Fixed: Volcano forge UI not showing favorites (correct) but affecting item selection.
       Implemented: Prevent favorited items from being placed in the shipping bin.
       
       * Fixed edge cases with forge UI and fixed favorite highlights not being shown.
       
       * Favorited item right-click behavior fixes:
          - Tools with attachments. This includes:
             - Fishing rod, with bait and lures
             - Slingshot, with ammo
          - Clothes/equipment
       
       * Added json translation support.
       Added 6th favorite highlight option - dark thick border.
       Updated readme.
       
       CHANGELOG:
        - Add new opt-in config option that adds a left-to-right warp with the gamepad cursor in inventory page.
        - Added "player_fixinventory" SMAPI console command. This command resizes the player's inventory to its correct maximum size, dropping any extra items contained in inventory.
          - Some mods directly modify the player's inventory size, causing compatibility issues and/or leaving extra null items when uninstalled; this command should fix these issues.
        - Support compatibility with "Vertical Toolbar" mod.
          - This should extend compatibility for all mods that modify the player's inventory size, even if in (what I'm presuming to be) irregular ways like this one.
        - Add new opt-in config option that allows quick stacking of items without checking quality.
        - New house packages (presents) should not be considered for quick stack.
        - tails618: "community center bundles in the inventory is gone... am I missing something?". Validate if this is true.
          - Validated cc button in inventory does appear, so this is not an issue.
        - Fixed volcano forge UI not showing favorites (correct) but affecting item selection.
        - Prevent favorited items from being placed in the shipping bin.
        - Double check Forge Menu behavior works with UI interaction. (I suspect it won't)
          - Narrator: "*It didn't*." Fixed edge cases with forge UI and fixed favorite highlights not being shown.
        - Favorited item click behavior fixes:
          - Right-clicking on tools with attachments. This includes:
            - Fishing rod, with bait and lures
            - Slingshot, with ammo
          - Clothes/equipment
        - Text localization support.
