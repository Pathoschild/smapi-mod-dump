       Convenient inventory 1.4.0 (#13)
       
       * Fixed tool/attachment logic when the attachment is favorited and the tool is not. Right-clicking a favorited attachment into an unfavorited tool no longer causes the mod to think you are still holding the favorited attachment.
       
       * Updated content loading to use GameContent
       
       * Initial changes required for SDV 1.6.
       
       * First pass at transpiler updates.
       
       * First pass at fixing compiler errors.
       
       * Removed references to deprecated Mill type. Updated manifest's minimum SMAPI version to 4.0.0-alpha.
       
       * Fixed Toolbar.Draw Transpiler failing due to some fields being changed in 1.6 from private => public.
