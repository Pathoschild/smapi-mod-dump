       Convenient inventory (#5)
       
       * Migrated in from separate repo.
       WIP - initial work for drawing nearby chests in quick stack button tooltip
       
       * Slight renaming. Normal/stone chests now draw correctly in quick stack tooltip. Overall tooltip layout and other types of chests are still WIP.
       
       * Tab instead of spaces.
       WIP - draw typed chests in tooltip.
       
       * Chests are rendered in correct position in tooltip.
       
       * Implemented GetChestType method
       
       * Buildings are now scaled and positioned correctly in Quick Stack tooltip.
       Junimo Hut sprite needs season change.
       Check if Mill is under construction before considering its chest.
       
       * Draw special chests (mini shipping bins, junimo chests). Correctly draw junimo hut based on current season.
       
       * Included island fridge as possible chest type.
       Kitchen fridge (both types) is now drawn correctly in tooltip.
       With this change, all chest types are now being drawn correctly on tooltip.
       
       * Finished quick stack.
       Initial work on favorite items.
       
       * WIP - Favorite items basic functionality is working.
       TODO:
       - Quick stack: Check if mill is under construction
       - Handle favorited items logic for other situations:
         - Auto stash
         - Clicking into chest
         - Dropping item
         - etc...
       - Persist favorites per player.
       - Draw highlight under items, not over.
       - Only allow favoriting items, not empty slots.
       - Draw highlights on hotbar.
       - Shift favorites down/up a row when swapping hotbar rows.
       
       * Workaround for FavoriteItemSlots not initialized when first inventory menu opened is not player's inventory page.
       
       * Favorite item slots now save and are unique for each player. Crafting page now correctly draws favorite items.
       
       * Slight changes to favorite item highlight styles
       
       * Added TODO plans for drawing favorite items highlights underneath items.

       * Reordered methods
       
       * Cleaned up code. Condensed multiple method overloads into single generically-typed methods.
       
       * Finished InventoryMenu transpiler for drawing highlights underneath items.
       
       * Attempted to show a favorite signifier on the item tooltip, might not be easily doable.
       
       * Removed attempt to signify favorite in item tooltip
       
       * WIP - draw favorite texture box border using transpiler
       
       * Favorited item tool tip border is now drawn correctly
       
       * Favoriting an item no longer selects the item at the same time.
       
       * Elaborated on TODO list
       
       * WIP - Favorite item slots are tracked when moving around in the inventory (for most cases, not all at the moment).
       Favoriting prevents dropping and selling.
       Implemented favorite item support for shops and other instant menus.
       
       * Finished incomplete favorite item slot "tracking" for Item.canStackWith logic and shift-click logic.
       
       * Eating/gifting/etc the last item of a favorited item slot now unfavorites it.
       Toolbar now draws favorite item slot highlights.
       
       * Cleaned up TODO
       
       * Convenient inventory sdv1.5.5 smapi3.13.1 (#3)
       
       * Updated to support Stardew Valley 1.5.5 (requires SMAPI 3.13.1)

       * Favorited items are now ignored when pressing the Organize button in inventories.
       
       * Finished implementing favorite items.
       TODO: Make sure each functionality correctly checks for IsEnableFavoriteItems
       
       * Caught any missing config checks for IsEnableFavoriteItems.
       This finalizes the features for a v1.0.0 release.
       
       * Fixed favorite item slot swapping not tracking the newly selected favorite item.
       
       * Added NexusMods update key.
       
       * Added support for inventory expansion mods.
       Specifically, fixed all (?) compatibility errors when playing with the Bigger Backpack mod.
