## Features
**Splitscreen Layouts**: Adds customizable splitscreen layouts to adjust where each player's screen is positioned.

**Show Player Name In Summary**: Shows the player name banner in end-of-day shipping summary and level up menus. This makes it easier to distinguish each player's screen; for example, to avoid unintended profession choices (speaking from personal experience!).
