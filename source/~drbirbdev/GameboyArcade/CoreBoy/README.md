CoreBoy emulator was originally ported to .NET by David Whitney.

https://github.com/davidwhitney/CoreBoy

This code is mostly the same internally.  Some dependencies have been stripped out to ease licensing requirements,
and some interfaces and code styles have been changed, but it is 99% similar to the original.
I may in the future see what optimizations or feature improvements I can make, but these will all be in relation
to the Stardew Valley mod.  I may cut out more code that I don't need as well, such as Null interfaces.
