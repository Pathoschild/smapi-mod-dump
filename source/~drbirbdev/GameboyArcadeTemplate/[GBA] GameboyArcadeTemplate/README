When packaging other peoples open-source Gameboy Roms, make sure to follow their LICENSE!

This is especially important if you plan to share the Rom publicly, such as on Nexus.

DON'T REDISTRIBUTE CLOSED SOURCE ROMS! IF I SEE CONTENT PACKS DISTRIBUTING NINTENDO OWNED OR CLOSED SOURCE ROMS THEY WILL BE REPORTED!
