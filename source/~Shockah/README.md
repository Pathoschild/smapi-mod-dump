# Shockah's Stardew Valley mods

This is a list of all Stardew Valley mods I made. Issues or ideas can be reported via [the GitHub issues page](issues), the Posts/Bugs tabs on the Nexus Mods pages, or via Discord (you can find me on the official Stardew Valley server, in the `#making-mods`, `#using-mods-help` and `#modded-farmers` channels, depending on the topic; my tag is `Shockah#1830`).

**Note:** The below list only includes mods I already made README files for. You can find the rest of the mods on this repository, or via [my Nexus Mods profile](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/133612513?tab=user+files).

* **Early Ginger Island** ([Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/13885), [GitHub](EarlyGingerIsland))  
  Access the Ginger Island early, depending on your friendship with Willy. Optionally access the Ginger Island west/farm, too. Configure the boat fix materials and ticket price.
* **Flexible Sprinklers** ([Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/10931), [GitHub](FlexibleSprinklers))  
  Ever hated having to put a sprinkler in the middle of your crops? Ever wanted to make a layout that isn't 5x5? Now you can!
* **Please Gift Me In Person** ([Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/11217), [GitHub](PleaseGiftMeInPerson))  
  Adds some more realism and life to the Gift Delivery Service. An extension to the [Mail Services Mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/7842).
