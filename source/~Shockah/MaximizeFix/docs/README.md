# Maximize Fix
Fixes a problem with game window maximization on Windows.

Both vanilla and modded game had a long-standing issue that REALLY bugged (heh) me. Whenever you maximize the game window on Windows (NOT go into fullscreen), the game seems to... not exactly do that. It gets rendered partially off screen (VERY annoying with multiple monitors), and gets cut off a bit on a side.  
This mod fixes this issue.
