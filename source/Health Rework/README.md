# Overview

In the vanilla game, health is a rather disposable resource, since the means by which it is recovered are quite ubiquitous and readily available. This mod intends to change that by limiting the two major sources of health recovery - consumables and sleep.
In its current state (v1.0.0), the mod does the following:
 ﻿
- ﻿Limits or negates all health recovered from consumables (excluding the Life Elixir),
- Tracks and preserves the current health value upon sleeping, recovering only a configurable magnitude of health.

The intent is, in part, to differentiate the function and recovery of health in opposition to stamina - health loss should be meaningful beyond the very short-term, and should impress upon the player's routines a significant but not overwhelming obstacle to be managed.
