[size=6]Use a Different Indoor Map[/size]

This guide will use Ellie's Ideal Greenhouse as the example
Find the content.json of the patch the content of which which should look something like the following

[code]{
    "Format": "1.19.0",
    "ConfigSchema": {
        "GreenhouseType": {"AllowValues": "Modest, Expanded, Spacious",
        "Default": "Modest"}
    },

    "Changes": [
        {
            "Action": "Load",
            "Target": "Maps/Greenhouse",
            "FromFile": "assets/{{GreenhouseType}} Greenhouse.tmx"
        },
    ]
}
[/code]


Modify the value of "Target" to "Maps/GreenhouseMap" 

The final result should look something like the following

[code]{
    "Format": "1.19.0",
    "ConfigSchema": {
        "GreenhouseType": {"AllowValues": "Modest, Expanded, Spacious",
        "Default": "Modest"}
    },

    "Changes": [
        {
            "Action": "Load",
            "Target": "Maps/GreenhouseMap",
            "FromFile": "assets/{{GreenhouseType}} Greenhouse.tmx"
        },
    ]
}
[/code]
