# Use a Different Indoor Map
This guide will use Ellie's Ideal Greenhouse as the example
Find the content.json of the patch the content of which which should look something like the following

	{
		"Format": "1.19.0",
		"ConfigSchema": {
			"GreenhouseType": {"AllowValues": "Modest, Expanded, Spacious",
			"Default": "Modest"}
		},
	
		"Changes": [
