# StopRugRemoval

Tired of having to pick up half your living room because you accidentally picked up the rug? So was I. This mod prevents you from being able to pick up a rug if there's something on it.

Configuration option `Enabled` works with Generic Mod Config Menu in case you want to temporarily disable the mod while playing.

Additionally: Prevents you from removing items from tables unless the `FurniturePlacementKey` is held down. (Default is `LeftShift + Z`). You can disable this behavior by deselecting `PreventRemovalFromTable`.

Installation: unzip and place in Mods folder. Uninstallation: simply delete from Mods folder.

Translations would be very welcome! DM me or submit a pull request.

* Much thanks to Vigor for the Portuguese translation!
