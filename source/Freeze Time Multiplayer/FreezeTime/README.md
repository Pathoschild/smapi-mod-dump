## This mod use Harmony to pause time by game's default code. It works just like the original version of the game.
## Also, here is a menu([GenericModConfigMenu](https://github.com/spacechase0/StardewValleyMods/tree/develop/GenericModConfigMenu)) to control Pause Logic.

## Main player must install this mod, it's optional for client player.

### Main player must install this mod, it's optional for client player, but I recommand client players install it, or it will cause some bug:(eg: client player cannot sleep with "Any" logic when time is pausing.
