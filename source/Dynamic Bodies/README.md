This repository contains my SMAPI mods for Stardew Valley. See the individual mods for
documentation and release notes.

## Mods
* **BusSprite mod** <small>([Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/11809))</small>  
  _Part of a mostly visual mod "Ribeena's vehicles", this makes the bus
  a bit more responsive and moves the bus door._

* **Dynamic Bodies** <small>([Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/12893))</small>
  _Overhaul of the Farmer Rendering to allow for customisable characters, includes
  new interfaces (Doctor's, Leah's and a bonus), adjusts the Wizard menu to
  also make these accessible, adjustments for Boots so they display on character,
  new tailoring menu for sleeves and easier coloring of boots, dual color hair,
  extended skin colors for naked overlays... and more._

The mods can be translated into any language supported by the game, and SMAPI will automatically
use the right translations.
