## Introduction
Dynamic Bodies uses a shader to fastly swap 25 colors to use selections. In order to make this
simpler, rather than loading those colors from the Farmer Sprite, these are standardised. You
can use the [palette image](../../assets/Character/palette_skin.png) to help you get the colors right.

## The Colors
