**Dynamic Bodies** is a [Stardew Valley](http://stardewvalley.net/) (SDV) mod which loads packs
to change and add options for the way the player renders, along with some new interfaces
to make it easy to use these options.

## For players
### Install
1. [Install the latest version of SMAPI](https://smapi.io/).
2. Install [this mod from Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/12893).
3. Unzip any Dynamic Bodies content packs into `Mods` to install them.
4. Run the game using SMAPI.

That's it! Content packs unzipped into `Mods` will be loaded and available as options, or
start working if they override vanilla parts.

### Compatibility
Dynamic Bodies is compatible with Stardew Valley 1.5+, both single-player and
multiplayer (allowing for custom look regardless of gender, and where same packs are installed,
the characters will look the same across games)
