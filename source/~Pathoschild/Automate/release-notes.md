# Release notes
## Upcoming release
* Fixed issue where upgrading a building which contains machines wouldn't always update automation correctly until the save was reloaded.

## 1.23.0
Released 25 May 2021.

* In multiplayer mode, machines which give XP, update stats, or check professions now target the farmer who placed them instead of the host player where possible.  
  _(Due to a game bug, this only affects crab pots and fish ponds currently; see a [summary for each machine](README.md#in-multiplayer-who-gets-xp-and-whose-professions-apply).)_

## 1.22.1
Released 17 April 2021.

* The option to prevent removing the last item in a stack (added in Automate 1.22) is now [configured per-chest](README.md#in-game-settings) instead of globally.

## 1.22
Released 27 March 2021.

* Added option to prevent removing the last item in a stack from chests.
* Fixed compatibility with [unofficial 64-bit mode](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Migrate_to_64-bit_on_Windows).

## 1.21.1
Released 07 March 2021.

* Trees that aren't full-grown are no longer automated, to avoid accidental machine links due to spreading seeds.

## 1.21
Released 06 February 2021.

* Added tree automation to collect seeds, golden coconuts, and Qi beans.
* You can now use furniture and floor dividers as connectors.
* Fixed tea bushes in garden pots not automated.
* Fixed bushes producing berries out of season once immediately after loading the save.

## 1.20.1
Released 23 January 2021.

* Updated for multi-key bindings in SMAPI 3.9.
* Fixed tappers on mahogany tree always producing one sap.
* Fixed errors when a chest contains an invalid item stack.

## 1.20
Released 16 January 2021.

* Added [full support for Junimo chests](README.md#junimo-chests), which enables distributed automation.
* Removed old `config.json` migrations. If you changed the mod options in Automate 1.17.3 or earlier, and haven't played since then, you may need to do it again.
* Moved the default machine priorities into `assets/data.json`. You can still override an entry in your `config.json`.
* Lowered priority for mini-shipping bins by default (similar to shipping bins).
* Fixed bushes not harvested out of season on the island farm.

## 1.19.1
Released 04 January 2021.

* When you join a multiplayer game, Automate shows a warning that it needs to be installed by the main player. That message is now clearer and only shown if they don't have it installed.
* Fixed slime egg incubators ignoring tiger slime eggs.
* Fixed deconstructor taking multiple inputs from the chest, but only producing output for the last one.

## 1.19
Released 21 December 2020.

* Updated for Stardew Valley 1.5, including...
  * split-screen mode and UI scaling;
  * new machines (bone mill, coffee maker, deconstructor, geode crusher, heavy tapper, hoppers, mini-shipping bin, ostrich incubator, solar panel, and statue of true perfection);
  * default shipping bin being moveable;
  * new chest and path types.

**Breaking changes for mod authors:**
* If you added a `chest.Capacity` property for Automate, you should patch or override the new
  `chest.GetActualCapacity()` method in 1.5 instead.
* Automate previously stored automation options in the chest name using tags like
  `|automate:no-store|`. These are now stored in the new `chest.modData` field added in 1.5; existing
  chests will be migrated automatically.

## 1.18.4
Released 05 December 2020.

* Internal changes to simplify upcoming updates.

## 1.18.3
Released 21 November 2020.

* Fixed shipped items not added to existing stacks if possible.
