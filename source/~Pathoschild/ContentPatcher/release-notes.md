# Release notes
<!--


STOP RIGHT THERE.
When releasing a format change, don't forget to update the smapi.io/json schema!


-->
## Upcoming release
* Fixed patches not applied correctly in some cases when added by a conditional `Include` patch.

## 1.22
Released 17 April 2021. See the [release highlights](https://www.patreon.com/posts/50144071).

* Added a [conditions API](docs/conditions-api.md), which lets other mods parse and use Content Patcher conditions.
* Added new tokens:
  * [`FirstValidFile`](docs/author-tokens-guide.md#FirstValidFile) to enable fallback files without duplicating patches.
  * [`HasActiveQuest`](docs/author-tokens-guide.md#HasActiveQuest) to check a player's current quest list.
* Improved console commands:
  * Added `patch export` argument to optionally set the data type.
  * Tweaked console command handling.
  * Fixed `patch export` for an asset that's not already loaded causing the wrong data type to be cached.
* The latest `Format` version now always matches the main Content Patcher version. Previously it only changed if the format changed.
* Fixed default log names for patches with multiple `FromFile` or `Target` values.

## 1.21.2
Released 27 March 2021.

* Simplified 'unsupported format' message to avoid confusion when players need to update Content Patcher.

* Fixed error when editing entries in `Data\RandomBundles`.
* Fixed misplaced warps when replacing some farm types.
* Fixed setting a map tile property to `null` not deleting it.
* Fixed compatibility with [unofficial 64-bit mode](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Migrate_to_64-bit_on_Windows).

* Added new tokens:
  * [`Render`](docs/author-tokens-guide.md#string-manipulation) to allow string comparison in `When` blocks.
  * `DailyLuck` to get a player's daily luck (thanks to Thom1729!).
* The `FarmhouseUpgrade` token can now check either the current player (default) or the host player.
* The `Enabled` field no longer allows tokens (in format version 1.21.0+).
* Improved default `LogName` for patches with multiple `Target` or `FromFile` values.
* Improved split-screen support.
* Fixed changes through [Generic Mod Config Menu](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5098) not correctly updating dynamic tokens and `Enabled` fields.

**Update note for mod authors:**  
If you use tokens in the `Enabled` field, updating the `Format` field to `1.21.0` or later will
cause errors. See the [migration guide](docs/author-migration-guide.md) for more info.

## 1.20
Released 06 February 2021. See the [release highlights](https://www.patreon.com/posts/47213526).

* Fixed string sorting/comparison for some special characters.
* Internal changes to prepare for realtime content updates.

**Update note for mod authors:**  
Using `"Action": "EditData"` with a `FromFile` field is now deprecated, though it still works.
Migrating to an `"Action": "Include"` patch is recommended; it's more flexible and works more
intuitively. (That doesn't apply to `"Action": "EditData"` patches without a `FromFile` field.)

## 1.15.2
Released 21 July 2020.

* Fixed error using `HasFile` with filenames containing commas.

**Update note for mod authors:**  
Updating the `Format` field to `1.15.0` or later requires changes to your `content.json`. See the [migration guide](docs/author-migration-guide.md) for more info.
