## Introduction
### Overview
A **token** is a named container which has predefined values.

For example, `season` (the token) may contain `spring`, `summer`, `fall`, or `winter` (the value).
Here's a dialogue which includes the current season name:
```js
"Entries": {
   "fri": "It's a beautiful {{season}} day!" // It's a beautiful Spring day!
}
```

Tokens can be used as _placeholders_ in text (like the above example) or as patch _conditions_. You
can use [player config](#player-config), [global token values](#global-tokens), and
[dynamic token values](#dynamic-tokens) as tokens.

### Placeholders
You can use tokens in text by putting two curly brackets around the token name, which will be
replaced with the actual value automatically.

Token placeholders can be used in most fields (the documentation for each field will specify), and
they're not case-sensitive (so `{{season}}` and `{{SEASON}}` are the same thing). Patches will be
disabled automatically if a token they use isn't currently available.

For example, this gives the farmhouse a different appearance in each season:

```js
{
    "Action": "EditImage",
    "Target": "Buildings/houses",
    "FromFile": "assets/{{season}}_house.png" // assets/spring_house.png, assets/summer_house.png, etc
}
```

Tokens which return a single value (like `{{season}}`) are most useful in placeholders, but
multi-value tokens will work too (they'll show a comma-delimited list).

### Conditions
You can make a patch conditional by adding a `When` field, which can list any number of conditions.
Each condition has...
* A key containing a [token](#introduction) without the outer curly braces, like
  `Season` or `HasValue:{{spouse}}`. The key is not case-sensitive.
* A value containing the comma-separated values to match, like `spring, summer`. If the key token
  returns any of these values, the condition matches. This field supports
  [tokens](#introduction) and is not case-sensitive.

For example, this changes the house texture only in spring or summer in the first year:

```js
{
    "Action": "EditImage",
    "Target": "Buildings/houses",
    "FromFile": "assets/{{season}}_house.png",
    "When": {
        "Season": "spring, summer",
        "Year": "1"
    }
}
```

Each condition is true if _any_ of its values match, and the patch is applied if _all_ of its
conditions match.

### Input arguments
An **input argument** or **input** is a value you give to the token within the `{{...}}` braces.
Input can be _positional_ (an unnamed list of values) or _named_. Argument values are
comma-separated, and named arguments are pipe-separated.

For example, `{{Random: a, b, c |key=some, value |example }}` has five arguments: three positional
values `a`, `b`, `c`; a named `key` argument with values `some` and `value`; and a named `example`
argument with an empty value.

Some tokens recognise input arguments to change their output, which are documented in the sections
below. For example, the `Uppercase` token makes its input uppercase:
```js
"Entries": {
   "fri": "It's a beautiful {{uppercase: {{season}}}} day!" // It's a beautiful SPRING day!
}
```

There are also [**global input arguments**](#global-input-arguments) which are handled by Content
Patcher, so they work with any token.

## Global tokens
Global token values are defined by Content Patcher, so you can use them without doing anything else.

}
```

ℹ See _[update rate](author-guide.md#update-rate)_ before using this token.

</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">

with a [`PlayerType`](#playertype) argument).

This is a decimal value usually between -0.1 and 0.1. This **cannot** be compared using the
`{{Range}}` token, which produces a range of integer values. The value can only be safely compared
using [query expressions](#query-expressions). For example:

```js
"When": {
   "Query: {{DailyLuck}} < 0": true // spirits unhappy today
}
```

<td>

The player's heart level with a given NPC. You can specify the character name as an input argument
(using their English name regardless of translations), like this:

```js
"When": {
   "Hearts:Abigail": "10, 11, 12, 13"
}
```

**Note:** this is only available once the save is fully loaded, so it may not reliably affect
conditional map spawn logic.

### World
<table>
<tr>
<th>condition</th>

`Mushrooms`.

</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td>FarmName</td>
<td>The name of the current farm.</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">

`FourCorners`, `Forest`, `Hilltop`, `Riverland`, `Wilderness`, `Custom`.

</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">

 `false`.

</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td>HavingChild</td>
<td>

The names of players and NPCs whose relationship has an active pregnancy or adoption. Player names
are prefixed with `@` to avoid ambiguity with NPC names. For example, to check if the current
player is having a child:

```js
"When": {
    "HavingChild": "{{spouse}}"
}
```

Usage notes:
* `"HavingChild": "@{{playerName}}"` and `"HavingChild": "{{spouse}}"` are equivalent for this token.
* See also the `Pregnant` token.

</td>
</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td>Pregnant</td>
<td>

The players or NPCs who are currently pregnant. This is a subset of `HavingChild` that only applies
to the female partner in heterosexual relationships. (Same-sex partners adopt a child instead.)

</td>
</tr>
</table>

### Number manipulation
<table>
<tr>
<th>condition</th>
<th>purpose</th>

<tr valign="top">
<td>Query</td>
<td>

Evaluate arbitrary arithmetic and logical operations; see [_query expressions_](#query-expressions)
for more info.

</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td>Range</td>
<td>

A list of integers between the specified min/max integers (inclusive). This is mainly meant for
comparing values; for example:

```js
"When": {
   "Hearts:Abigail": "{{Range: 6, 14}}" // equivalent to "6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14"
}
```

You can use tokens for the individual numbers (like `{{Range:6, {{MaxHearts}}}}`) or both (like
`{{Range:{{FriendshipRange}}}})`, as long as the final parsed input has the form `min, max`.

To minimise the possible performance impact, the range can't exceed 5000 numbers and should be much
smaller if possible.

</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td>Round</td>
<td>

An approximation of the input number with fewer fractional digits.

In its default form, this just rounds to the nearest whole number. For example,
`{{Round: 2.1 }}` results in `2`, and `{{Round: 2.5555 }}` results in `3`.

The token takes optional arguments to change the rounding logic:

usage | result | description
----- | ------ | -----------
`Round(2.5555)` | `3` | Round to the nearest whole number.
`Round(2.5555, 2)` | `2.56` | Round to the nearest value with the given number of fractional digits.
`Round(2.5555, 2, down)` | `2.55` | Round `up` or `down` to the given number of fractional digits. This overrides the default [half rounded to even](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rounding#Round_half_to_even) behavior.

This is mainly useful in combination with [query expressions](#query-expressions). For example,
monster HP must be a whole number, so this rounds the result of a calculation to the nearest whole
number:

```js
{
  "Action": "EditData",
  "Target": "Data/Monsters",
  "Fields": {
    "Green Slime": {
      "0": "{{Round: {{Query: {{multiplier}} * 2.5 }} }}",
    }
  }
}
```

You can use tokens in the individual fields (like `{{Round: {{value}}, 2}}`) or for multiple fields
at once (like `{{Round: {{Settings}}}}` where `{{Settings}}` = `2.5, 3, up`), as long as the final
parsed input matches one of the above forms.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

### String manipulation
<table>
<tr>
<th>condition</th>
<th>purpose</th>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Lowercase<br />Uppercase</td>
<td>

Convert the input text to a different letter case:

<dl>
<dt>Lowercase</dt>
<dd>

Change to all small letters.<br />Example: `{{Lowercase:It's a warm {{Season}} day!}}` &rarr; `it's a warm summer day!`

</dd>
<dt>Uppercase</dt>
<dd>

Change to all capital letters.<br />Example: `{{Uppercase:It's a warm {{Season}} day!}}` &rarr; `IT'S A WARM SUMMER DAY!`

</dd>
</dl>
</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Render</td>
<td>

Get the string representation of the input argument. This is mainly useful in `When` blocks to
compare the rendered value directly (instead of comparing token set values):

```js
"When": {
   "Render:{{season}} {{day}}": "spring 14"
}
```

This isn't needed in other contexts, where you can use token placeholders directly. For example,
these two entries are equivalent:

```js
"Entries": {
   "Mon": "It's a lovely {{season}} {{day}}!",
   "Mon": "It's a lovely {{Render: {{season}} {{day}} }}!",
}
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>

### Metadata
These tokens provide meta info about tokens, content pack files, installed mods, and the game state.

<table>
<tr>
<th>condition</th>
<th>purpose</th>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td>HasMod</td>
<td>

The installed mod IDs (matching the `UniqueID` field in their `manifest.json`).

</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td>HasFile</td>
<td>

Whether a file exists in the content pack folder. The file path must be specified as an input
argument. Returns `true` or `false`. For example:

```js
"When": {
  "HasFile:assets/{{season}}.png": "true"
}
```

If the input has commas like `HasFile: a, b.png`, they're treated as part of the filename.

</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td>HasValue</td>
<td>

Whether the input argument is non-blank. For example, to check if the player is married to anyone:

```js
"When": {
  "HasValue:{{spouse}}": "true"
}
```

This isn't limited to a single token. You can pass in any tokenized string, and `HasValue` will
return true if the resulting string is non-blank:

```js
"When": {
  "HasValue:{{spouse}}{{LocationName}}": "true"
}
```

</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td>i18n</td>
<td>

Get text from the content pack's `i18n` translation files. See [_Translations_ in the author
guide](author-guide.md#Translations) for more info.

</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td>Language</td>
<td>

The game's current language. Possible values:

code | meaning
---- | -------
`de` | German
`en` | English
`es` | Spanish
`fr` | French
`hu` | Hungarian
`it` | Italian
`ja` | Japanese
`ko` | Korean
`pt` | Portuguese
`ru` | Russian
`tr` | Turkish
`zh` | Chinese

</td>
</tr>
</table>

### Field references
These tokens contain field values for the current patch. For example, `{{FromFile}}` is the current
value of the `FromFile` patch field.

These have some restrictions:
* They're only available in a patch block directly (e.g. they won't work in dynamic tokens).
* They can't be used in their source field. For example, you can't use `{{Target}}` in the `Target`
  field.
* You can't create circular references. For example, you can use `{{FromFile}}` in the `Target`
  field and `{{Target}}` in the `FromFile` field, but not both at once.

<table>
<tr>
<th>condition</th>
<th>purpose</th>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td>FromFile</td>
<td>

The patch's `FromFile` field value for the current asset. Path separators are normalized for the OS.
This is mainly useful for checking if the path exists:

```js
{
   "Action": "EditImage",
   "Target": "Characters/Abigail",
   "FromFile": "assets/{{Season}}_abigail.png",
   "When": {
      "HasFile:{{FromFile}}": true
   }
}
```

</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td>Target</td>
<td>

The patch's `Target` field value for the current asset. Path separators are normalized for the OS.
This is mainly useful for patches which specify multiple targets:

```js
{
   "Action": "EditImage",
   "Target": "Characters/Abigail, Characters/Sam",
   "FromFile": "assets/{{Target}}.png" // assets/Characters/Abigail.png *or* assets/Characters/Sam.png
}
```

</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td>TargetPathOnly</td>
<td>

Equivalent to `Target`, but only the part before the last path separator:

```js
{
   "Action": "EditImage",
   "Target": "Characters/Abigail, Portraits/Abigail",
   "FromFile": "assets/{{TargetPathOnly}}/recolor.png" // assets/Characters/recolor.png *or* assets/Portraits/recolor.png
}
```

</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td>TargetWithoutPath</td>
<td>

Equivalent to `Target`, but only the part after the last path separator:

```js
{
   "Action": "EditImage",
   "Target": "Characters/Abigail, Characters/Sam",
   "FromFile": "assets/{{TargetWithoutPath}}.png" // assets/Abigail.png *or* assets/Sam.png
}
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Global input arguments
Global [input arguments](#input-arguments) are handled by Content Patcher itself, so they work with
all tokens (including mod-provided tokens).

### Token search
The `contains` argument returns `true` or `false` depending on whether the token contains any of
the given values. This is mainly useful for logic in [conditions](#conditions):

```js
// player has blacksmith OR gemologist
"When": {
   "HasProfession": "Blacksmith, Gemologist"
}

// player has blacksmith AND gemologist
"When": {
   "HasProfession |contains=Blacksmith": "true",
   "HasProfession |contains=Gemologist": "true"
}

// NOT year 1
"When": {
   "Year |contains=1": "false"
}
```

This can also be used in placeholders. For example, this will load a different file depending on
whether the player has the `Gemologist` profession:
```js
{
    "Action": "EditImage",
    "Target": "Buildings/houses",
    "FromFile": "assets/gems-{{HasProfession |contains=Gemologist}}.png" // assets/gems-true.png
}
```

You can specify multiple values, in which case it returns whether _any_ of them match:
```js
// player has blacksmith OR gemologist
"When": {
   "HasProfession |contains=Blacksmith, Gemologist": "true"
}

// player has neither blacksmith NOR gemologist
"When": {
   "HasProfession |contains=Blacksmith, Gemologist": "false"
}
```

### Custom input value separator
By default input arguments are comma-separated, but sometimes it's useful to allow commas in the
input values. You can use the `inputSeparator` argument to use a different separator (which can be
one or multiple characters).

For example, this can allow commas in random dialogue:

```json
"Entries": {
   "fri": "{{Random: Hey, how are you? @@ Hey, what's up? |inputSeparator=@@}}"
```

**Note:** you should avoid the `{}|=:` characters in separators, even if they're technically valid.
The behavior when separators conflict with token syntax depends on implementation details that may
change from one Content Patcher version to the next.

## Player config
You can let players configure your mod using a `config.json` file. Content Patcher will
automatically create and load the file, and you can use the config values as
[tokens & conditions](#introduction). Config fields are not case-sensitive.

If the player has [Generic Mod Config Menu](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5098)
installed, they'll be able to configure the mod through an in-game options menu on the title
screen or the in-game menu.

To do this, you add a `ConfigSchema` section which defines your config fields and how to validate
them (see below for an example).
Available fields for each field:

   field               | meaning
   ------------------- | -------
   `AllowValues`       | _(optional.)_ The values the player can provide, as a comma-delimited string. If omitted, any value is allowed.<br />**Tip:** use `"true, false"` for a field that can be enabled or disabled, and Content Patcher will recognize it as a boolean (e.g. to represent as a checkbox in Generic Mod Config Menu).
   `AllowBlank`        | _(optional.)_ Whether the field can be left blank. If false or omitted, blank fields will be replaced with the default value.
   `AllowMultiple`     | _(optional.)_ Whether the player can specify multiple comma-delimited values. Default false.
   `Default`           | _(optional unless `AllowBlank` is false.)_ The default values when the field is missing. Can contain multiple comma-delimited values if `AllowMultiple` is true. If omitted, blank fields are left blank.
   `Description`       | _(optional.)_ An explanation of the config option for the player. This is shown in UIs like Generic Mod Config Menu.

For example: this `content.json` defines a `Material` config field and uses it to change which
patch is applied. See below for more details.

```js
{
   "Format": "1.21.0",
   "ConfigSchema": {
      "Material": {
         "AllowValues": "Wood, Metal",
         "Default": "Wood",
         "Description": "The material style for the billboard background."
      }
   },
   "Changes": [
      // as a token
      {
         "Action": "Load",
         "Target": "LooseSprites/Billboard",
         "FromFile": "assets/material_{{material}}.png"
      },

      // as a condition
      {
         "Action": "Load",
         "Target": "LooseSprites/Billboard",
         "FromFile": "assets/material_wood.png",
         "When": {
            "Material": "Wood"
         }
      }
   ]
}
```

When you run the game, a `config.json` file will appear automatically with text like this:

```js
{
  "Material": "Wood"
}
```

Players can edit it to configure your content pack.

## Randomization
### Overview
You can randomize values using the `Random` token:
```js
{
   "Action": "Load",
   "Target": "Characters/Abigail",
   "FromFile": "assets/abigail-{{Random:hood, jacket, raincoat}}.png"
}
```

And you can optionally use pinned keys to keep multiple `Random` tokens in sync (see below for more
info):
```js
{
   "Action": "Load",
   "Target": "Characters/Abigail",
   "FromFile": "assets/abigail-{{Random:hood, jacket, raincoat |key=outfit}}.png",
   "When": {
      "HasFile:assets/abigail-{{Random:hood, jacket, raincoat |key=outfit}}.png": true
   }
}
```

This token is dynamic and may behave in unexpected ways; see below to avoid surprises.

### Unique properties
`Random` tokens are...

<ol>
<li>

**Dynamic.** Random tokens rechoose when they're evaluated, generally when a new day starts. The
randomness is seeded with the game seed + in-game date + input string, so reloading the save won't
change which choices were made.

</li>
<li>

**Independent**. Each `Random` token changes separately. In particular:

* If a patch has multiple `Target` values, `Random` may have a different value for each target.
* If a `FromFile` field has a `Random` token, you can't just copy its value into a `HasFile` field
  to check if the file exists, since `Random` may return a different choice in each field.

To keep multiple `Random` tokens in sync, see _pinned keys_ below.
</li>
<li>

**Fair**. Each option has an equal chance of being chosen. To load the dice, just specify a value multiple
times. For example, 'red' is twice as likely as 'blue' in this patch:
```js
{
   "Action": "Load",
   "Target": "Characters/Abigail",
   "FromFile": "assets/abigail-{{Random:red, red, blue}}.png"
}
```

</li>
<li>

**Bounded** if the choices don't contain tokens. For example, you can use it in true/false contexts
if all the choices are 'true' or 'false', or numeric contexts if all the choices are numbers.

</li>
</ul>

### Update rate
A `Random` token changes its choices on day start by default. If you want randomization to change
within a day, you need to make two changes:

* Specify a [patch update rate](author-guide.md#update-rate) so the patch itself updates more often.
* Use a [pinned key](#pinned-key) to set the seed to a value which changes more often. For example,
  this would change every time the in-game time changes:
  ```
  {{Random: a, b, c |key={{Time}} }}
  ```
  Note that `{{Random}}` tokens with the same key will synchronize their values. You can make the
  key unique to avoid that:
  ```
  {{Random: a, b, c |key=Abigail portraits {{Time}} }}
  ```

### Pinned keys
<dl>
<dt>Basic pinned keys:</dt>
<dd>

If you need multiple `Random` tokens to make the same choices (e.g. to keep an NPC's portrait and
sprite in sync), you can specify a 'pinned key'. This is like a name for the random; every `Random`
token with the same pinned key will make the same choice. (Note that list order does matter.)

For example, this keeps Abigail's sprite and portrait in sync using `abigail-outfit` as the pinned
key:
```js
{
   "Action": "Load",
   "Target": "Characters/Abigail, Portraits/Abigail",
   "FromFile": "assets/{{Target}}-{{Random:hood, jacket, raincoat |key=abigail-outfit}}.png"
}
```

You can use tokens in a pinned key. For example, this synchronizes values separately for each NPC:
```js
{
   "Action": "Load",
   "Target": "Characters/Abigail, Portraits/Abigail, Characters/Haley, Portraits/Haley",
   "FromFile": "assets/{{Target}}-{{Random:hood, jacket, raincoat |key={{TargetWithoutPath}}-outfit}}.png"
}
```

<dt>Advanced pinned keys:</dt>
<dd>

The pinned key affects the internal random number used to make a choice, not the choice itself. You
can use it with `Random` tokens containing different values (even different numbers of values) for
more interesting features.

For example, this gives Abigail and Haley random outfits but ensures they never wear the same one:
```js
{
   "Action": "Load",
   "Target": "Characters/Abigail, Portraits/Abigail",
   "FromFile": "assets/{{Target}}-{{Random:hood, jacket, raincoat |key=outfit}}.png"
},
{
   "Action": "Load",
   "Target": "Characters/Haley, Portraits/Haley",
   "FromFile": "assets/{{Target}}-{{Random:jacket, raincoat, hood |key=outfit}}.png"
}
```

</dd>

<dt>Okay, I'm confused. What the heck are pinned keys?</dt>
<dd>

Without pinned keys, each token will randomly choose its own value:
```txt
{{Random: hood, jacket, raincoat}} = raincoat
{{Random: hood, jacket, raincoat}} = hood
{{Random: hood, jacket, raincoat}} = jacket
```

If they have the same pinned key, they'll always be in sync:
```txt
{{Random: hood, jacket, raincoat |key=outfit}} = hood
{{Random: hood, jacket, raincoat |key=outfit}} = hood
{{Random: hood, jacket, raincoat |key=outfit}} = hood
```

For basic cases, you just need to know that same options + same key = same value.

If you want to get fancy, then the way it works under the hood comes into play. Setting a pinned
key doesn't sync the choice, it syncs the _internal number_ used to make that choice:
```txt
{{Random: hood, jacket, raincoat |key=outfit}} = 217437 modulo 3 choices = index 0 = hood
{{Random: hood, jacket, raincoat |key=outfit}} = 217437 modulo 3 choices = index 0 = hood
{{Random: hood, jacket, raincoat |key=outfit}} = 217437 modulo 3 choices = index 0 = hood
```

You can use that in interesting ways. For example, shifting the values guarantees they'll never
choose the same value (since same index = different value):
```txt
{{Random: hood, jacket, raincoat |key=outfit}} = 217437 modulo 3 choices = index 0 = hood
{{Random: jacket, raincoat, hood |key=outfit}} = 217437 modulo 3 choices = index 0 = jacket
```
</dd>
</dl>

## Advanced
### Dynamic tokens
Dynamic tokens are defined in a `DynamicTokens` section of your `content.json` (see example below).
Each block in this section defines the value for a token using these fields:

field   | purpose
------- | -------
`Name`  | The name of the token to use for [tokens & condition](#introduction).
`Value` | The value(s) to set. This can be a comma-delimited value to give it multiple values. If _any_ block for a token name has multiple values, it will only be usable in conditions. This field supports [tokens](#introduction), including dynamic tokens defined before this entry.
`When`  | _(optional)_ Only set the value if the given [conditions](#introduction) match. If not specified, always matches.

Some usage notes:
* You can list any number of dynamic token blocks.
* If you list multiple blocks for the same token name, the last one whose conditions match will be
  used.
* You can use tokens in the `Value` and `When` fields. That includes dynamic tokens if they're
  defined earlier in the list (in which case the last applicable value _defined before this block_
  will be used). Using a token in the value implicitly adds a `When` condition (so the block is
  skipped if the token is unavailable, like `{{season}}` when a save isn't loaded).
* Dynamic tokens can't have the same name as an existing global token or player config field.

For example, this `content.json` defines a custom `{{style}}` token and uses it to load different
crop sprites depending on the weather:

```js
{
   "Format": "1.21.0",
   "DynamicTokens": [
      {
         "Name": "Style",
         "Value": "dry"
      },
      {
         "Name": "Style",
         "Value": "wet",
         "When": {
            "Weather": "rain, storm"
         }
      }
   ],
   "Changes": [
      {
         "Action": "Load",
         "Target": "TileSheets/crops",
         "FromFile": "assets/crop-{{style}}.png"
      }
   ]
}
```

## Query expressions
A _query expression_ is an arbitrary set of arithmetic and logical expressions which can be
evaluated into a number, `true`/`false` value, or text.

### Usage
Query expressions are evaluated using the `Query` token. It can be used as a placeholder or condition,
and can include nested tokens. Here's an example which includes all of those:
```js
{
   "Format": "1.21.0",
   "Changes": [
      {
         "Action": "EditData",
         "Target": "Characters/Dialogue/Abigail",
         "Entries": {
            "Mon": "Hard to imagine you only arrived {{query: {{DaysPlayed}} / 28}} months ago!"
         },
         "When": {
            "query: {{Hearts:Abigail}} >= 10": true
         }
      }
   ]
}
```

You can use text values in expressions if they're single-quoted (including tokens which return text):
```js
"Query: '{{Season}}' = 'spring'": true
```

Expressions are case-insensitive, including when comparing text values.

### Caveats
Query expressions are very powerful, but you should be aware of the caveats:

* Query expressions have **very little validation**. An invalid expression generally won't show
  warnings ahead of time, it'll just fail when the patch is applied. Make sure to carefully test
  any content pack features which use expressions, and check new or edited expressions with
  [`patch parse`](author-guide.md#patch-parse).
* Query expressions **evaluate the expanded text**. For example, if the player name contains a
  single-quote like `D'Artagnan`, then this expression will fail due to a syntax error:
  ```js
  "Query: '{{PlayerName}}' LIKE 'D*'": true // 'D'Artagnan' LIKE 'D*'
  ```
* Query expressions may return obscure or technical error messages when invalid.
* Query expressions may make your content pack harder to read and understand.

Consider using non-expression features instead where possible. For example:

<table>
<tr>
<th>With query expression</th>
<th>Without query expression</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```js
"When": {
   "Query: {{Time}} >= 0600 AND {{Time}} <= 1200": true
}
```

</td>
<td>

```js
"When": {
   "Time": "{{Range: 0600, 1200}}"
}
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>

### Operators
The supported operators are listed below.

* Perform arithmetic on numeric values (like `5 + 5`):

  operator | effect
  -------- | ---------
  \+       | addition
  \-       | subtraction
  \*       | multiplication
  /        | division
  %        | modulus
  ()       | grouping

* Compare two values (like `5 < 10`):

  operator | effect
  -------- | ---------
  `<`      | less than
  `<=`     | less than or equal
  `>`      | more than
  `>=`     | more than or equal
  `=`      | equal
  `<>`     | not equal

* Combine expressions using logical operators:

  operator | effect
  -------- | ------
  `AND`    | both expressions are true, like `{{Time}} >= 0600 AND {{Time}} <= 1200`.
  `OR`     | one or both expressions are true, like `{{Time}} <= 1200 OR {{Time}} >= 2400`.
  `NOT`    | negate the following expression, like `NOT {{Time}} > 1200`.

* Group sub-expressions using `()` to avoid an ambiguous order of operations:

  ```js
  "{{Query}}: ({{Time}} >= 0600 AND {{Time}} <= 1200) OR {{Time}} > 2400": true
  ```

* Check whether a value is `IN` or `NOT IN` a list:

  ```js
  "Query: '{{spouse}}' IN ('Abigail', 'Leah', 'Maru')": true
  ```

* Check text against a prefix/postfix using the `LIKE` or `NOT LIKE` operator. The wildcard `*` can
  only be at the start/end of the string, and it can only be used with quoted text (e.g. `LIKE '1'` will work but `LIKE 1` will return an error).

  ```js
  "Query: '{{spouse}}' LIKE 'Abig*'": true
  ```

### Mod-provided tokens
SMAPI mods can add new tokens for content packs to use (see [_extensibility for modders_](extensibility.md)),
which work just like normal Content Patcher tokens. For example, this patch uses a token from Json
Assets:
```js
{
   "Format": "1.21.0",
   "Changes": [
      {
         "Action": "EditData",
         "Target": "Data/NpcGiftTastes",
         "Entries": {
            "Universal_Love": "74 446 797 373 {{spacechase0.jsonAssets/ObjectId:item name}}",
         }
      }
   ]
}
```

To use a mod-provided token, at least one of these must be true:
* The mod which provides the token is a [required dependency](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Modder_Guide/APIs/Manifest#Dependencies)
  of your content pack.
* Or the patch using the token has an immutable (i.e. not using any tokens) `HasMod` condition
  which lists the mod:
  ```js
  {
     "Format": "1.21.0",
     "Changes": [
        {
           "Action": "EditData",
           "Target": "Data/NpcGiftTastes",
           "Entries": {
              "Universal_Love": "74 446 797 373 {{spacechase0.jsonAssets/ObjectId:item name}}",
           },
           "When": {
              "HasMod": "spacechase0.jsonAssets"
           }
        }
     ]
  }
  ```

## Constants
These are predefined values used in tokens.

### `LocationContext`
value | meaning
----- | -------
`Island` | Locations on the [Ginger Island](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Ginger_Island).
`Valley` | Any other location.

The location context can be specified as an [input argument](#input-arguments) for tokens that
support it, defaulting to the current location. For example:

example | meaning
------- | -------
`{{Weather}}`<br />`{{Weather: current}}` | Get weather for the current location.
`{{Weather: island}}` | Get the weather on Ginger Island.
`{{Weather: valley}}` | Get the weather in the valley.

### `PlayerType`
value | meaning
----- | -------
`currentPlayer` | The current player who has the mod installed.
`hostPlayer` | The player hosting the multiplayer world. This is the same as `currentPlayer` in single-player or if the current player is hosting.

The player type can be specified as an [input argument](#input-arguments) for tokens that support it,
defaulting to the current player. For example:

example | meaning
------- | -------
`{{HasFlag}}` | Get flags for the current player.
`{{HasFlag: hostPlayer}}` | Get flags for the host player.
`{{HasFlag: currentPlayer, hostPlayer}}` | Get flags for the current _and_ host player(s).
