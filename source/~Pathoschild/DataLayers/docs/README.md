visual data like accessibility, bee/Junimo/scarecrow/sprinkler coverage, etc. It automatically
includes data from other mods if applicable.

## Install
1. [Install the latest version of SMAPI](https://smapi.io/).
2. [Install this mod from Nexus mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1691).
3. Run the game using SMAPI.

## Use
Press `F2` to show the overlay, and then `left CTRL` and `right CTRL` to cycle between layers
(buttons configurable).

For coverage layers (e.g. scarecrows or sprinklers), point at one with the cursor to see a blue
border around that one's range and a green border around the coverage without it.

Below are the current data layers.

### Accessible
Shows where you can walk and highlights warp tiles; useful for finding hidden paths and nooks.

### Machine processing
Shows whether your machines are empty, processing, or finished. (You need to install
[Automate](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1063) for this layer to appear, but it'll
work for machines that aren't being automated too.)

The grid layer shows [tile borders](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Modder_Guide/Game_Fundamentals#Tiles)
useful for planning layouts, calculating fishing distance, etc:
