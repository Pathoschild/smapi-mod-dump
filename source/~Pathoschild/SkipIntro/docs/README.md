**Skip Intro** is a minimal [Stardew Valley](http://stardewvalley.net/) mod that skips straight to
the title screen when you start the game. You can optionally skip to the load screen, co-op join
screen, or co-op host screen instead. It also skips the screen transitions, so starting the game is
much faster.

## Install
1. [Install the latest version of SMAPI](https://smapi.io/).
2. Install [this mod from Nexus mods](http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/533).
3. Run the game using SMAPI.

## Configure
If you install [Generic Mod Config Menu][], you can click the cog button (âš™) on the title screen
or the "mod options" button at the bottom of the in-game menu to configure the mod. Hover the
cursor over a field for details.

multiplayer. There are no known issues in multiplayer (even if other players don't have it installed).
