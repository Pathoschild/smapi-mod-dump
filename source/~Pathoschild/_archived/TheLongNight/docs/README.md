**The Long Night** is a [Stardew Valley](http://stardewvalley.net/) mod that disables collapsing.
You just stay awake forever and the night never ends (until you go to bed).

## Install
1. [Install the latest version of SMAPI](https://smapi.io/).
2. [Install this mod from Nexus mods](http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1369).
3. Run the game using SMAPI.

## Use
The mod is automatic â€” just stay up past 2am, as long as you want. All in-season fish come out after
2am.

## Compatibility
The Long Night is compatible with Stardew Valley 1.3+ on Linux/Mac/Windows, both single-player and
multiplayer.

In multiplayer mode, any player with The Long Night installed can stay up past 2am. Players without
it will collapse at 2am like usual, and will need to wait for the other players to finish. If the
main player doesn't have it installed, they'll collapse at 2am which will force other players to
end their day too (which will take effect when they change location).
