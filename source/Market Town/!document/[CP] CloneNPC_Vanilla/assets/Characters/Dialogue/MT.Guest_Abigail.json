  "Event_Grave2": "Sure. I don't want to kill anything, either. I just want to do a little exploring without risking my neck!#$b#I've lived in the valley my whole life, but I've never really done anything memorable. I want to go on an adventure!$8",
  "Event_Grave3": "Oh, it's because I'm a girl... isn't it? Ugh...$u^Why? I'm just as strong as you!$a#$b#I'm not some fragile princess.. I can take care of myself!$a#$b#I've lived in the valley my whole life, but I've never really done anything memorable. I want to go on an adventure!$8",
