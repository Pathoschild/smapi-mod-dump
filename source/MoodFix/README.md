Several bugs exist regarding animal happiness in Stardew Valley:

 * If the player stays awake past 6pm and the season isn't winter, animals will lose 4-8 happiness every 10 minutes down to a minimum of 150.
 * If the player has the Coopmaster or Shepherd profession and pets a relevant animal when the animal's happiness was already very high, its happiness may drop a lot instead of capping at the max internal value.

This mod fixes both of these bugs. Feel free to open issues if you have any!
