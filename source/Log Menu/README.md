# Log Menu
**Log Menu** is a Stardew Valley mod that adds a Log Menu to display previously seen in-game dialogue. This mod is inspired by the Log/History feature implemented in visual novel games and some RPGs.

### `config.json`
A `config.json` file will be created in the mod folder when it is run for the first time. You can open that file in a text editor to configure the mod. If you make a mistake, you can delete the `config.json` file and it will create a default one.

## Compatibility
Log Menu is compatible with Stardew Valley 1.5.6 on Linux, MacOS, and Windows.

## To-Do
- ~~Remove empty strings from dialogue list (i.e., when a dialogue box with a question has responses but no text)~~
- Implement config option to log HUD messages
- Implement config option to log dialogue from skipped cutscenes
- Allow player to open Log Menu while a dialogue box is open and return to the dialogue box when the log menu is closed (???)
- When player selects response to question, update Log Menu to make the selected response bold (???)
