# Log Menu
**Log Menu** is a Stardew Valley mod that adds a Log Menu to display previously seen in-game dialogue. This mod is inspired by the Log/History feature implemented in visual novel games and some RPGs. If you accidentally skipped through a line of dialogue or just want to look at it again, this is the mod for you! ðŸ˜„

## Install
1. [Install the latest version of SMAPI.](https://smapi.io/)
2. [Install this mod from Nexus Mods.](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/19919)
3. (optional) [Install Generic Mod Config Menu from Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5098) for in-game mod configuration editing (more info below).
4. Run the game using SMAPI.

## Usage
Press `L` to display the Log Menu. The 50 most recent dialogue lines will be shown. The dialogue lines shown are configurable (more info below) and include lines both spoken and not spoken by NPCs, in-game dialogue questions, as well as HUD messages. In addition, this mod supports UI changes, custom dialogue lines, and custom NPCs.

## Configuration
### In-Game
If you have [Generic Mod Config Menu](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5098) installed, you can click the cog button (âš™) on the title screen or the "Mod Options" button at the bottom of the in-game options menu to configure the mod. Hover the cursor over a field for more details, or see the next section.

### `config.json`
A `config.json` file will be created in the mod folder after it is run for the first time. You can open that file in a text editor to configure the mod. If you make a mistake, you can delete the `config.json` file and a new one will be created next time the game is launched.

## Compatibility

## To-Do
Last three on the list below are complicated (and/or I am too lazy to fix/implement them lol) and will likely take a while to be implemented, if at all.

- ~~Remove empty strings from dialogue list (i.e., when a dialogue box with a question has responses but no text)~~
- ~~Implement config option to log HUD messages~~
- ~~Support changing portrait backgrounds~~
- ~~Hide character portrait if portrait not visible in original dialogue box~~
- Implement config option to log dialogue from skipped cutscenes
- Allow player to open Log Menu while a dialogue box is open and return to the dialogue box when the log menu is closed
- When player selects response to question, update Log Menu to make the selected response bold
