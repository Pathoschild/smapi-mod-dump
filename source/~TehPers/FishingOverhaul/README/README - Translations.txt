If you'd like to create a translation or fix an existing translation:
 - If the translation file doesn't exist:
   - Run the game and switch to the language you'd like to translate to from a different language.
   - You *must* switch to it, even if it's already enabled. If it is, switch to another language and then back.
 - Make the changes you want in the translation file associated with your language. The file named ".json" is the English file.
   - {0} indicates whatever value would go there. It uses C#'s string.Format method, so if you look up formatting codes for it, you can find a tutorial on string formatting.
 - Optional: If a translation is wrong or missing, send me your translation file on Discord: https://discord.gg/nJ3g6 (TehPers)
   - I'll add your name to the credits file.
