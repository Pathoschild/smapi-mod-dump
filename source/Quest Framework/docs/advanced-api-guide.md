# Advanced API guide

aka mod api for use in SMAPI mods (written in C#)

## Installation

1. Download Quest Framework from [Nexusmods](todo)
2. Copy contents of ZIP file to the mods folder in StardewValley folder
3. Create new SMAPI mod with VisualStudio
4. Reference QuestFramework dll in your project references (from the SDV mods folder)

### How to use

You can access Quest Framework API via [SMAPI's mod API provider](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Modder_Guide/APIs/Integrations#Using_an_API)

```csharp
using QuestFramework.API
using StardewModdingAPI;

class ModEntry : Mod
{
    public override void Entry(IModHelper helper)
    {
        helper.Events.GameLoop.GameLaunched += this.OnGameStarted;
    }
  
    private void OnGameStarted(object sender, GameLaunchedEventArgs e)
    {
        IQuestApi api = this.Helper.ModRegistry.GetApi<IQuestApi>("PurrplingCat.QuestFramework");
        IManagedQuestApi managedApi = api.GetManagedApi(this.ModManifest);
        
        api.Events.GettingReady += (_sender, _e) => {
            managedApi.RegisterQuest(/* enter quest definition here */);
        };
    }
}
```

## Lifecycle

1. `DISABLED`
Before onGameLaunched and when QF's Entry() method called
2. `STANDBY`
After onGameLaunched
**Register hook observers here**
3. `AWAITING`
Only in multiplayer and on client-side. Waiting for init message
4. `LAUNCHING`
On game loaded (and init message received in multiplayer on client-side) 
**Register your quests, offers and assign hooks on quests here**
5. `LAUNCHED`
Game loaded and all Quest Framework stuff initialized
6. `CLEANING` 
Returning to title screen. Next state is *STANDBY*.
**Clean your specialized custom stuff with QF here**

## Events

Event              | Summary                           
------------------ | ---------------------------------
ChangeState        | Raised when Quest Framework's lifecycle state changed.
GettingReady       | Raised when Quest Framework is in state `Launching` at least before QF is going to state `Launched`. **Best place for register your custom quests.**
Ready              | Raised when lifecycle state is `Launched` and all important Quest Framework systems are ready.
QuestCompleted     | Raised when any quest (managed or unmanaged) completed.
QuestAccepted      | Raised when any quest (managed or unmanaged) accepted and added to questlog.
QuestRemoved       | Raised when any quest (managed or unmanaged) removed from questlog.
QuestLogMenuOpen   | Raised when questlog menu was open.
QuestLogMenuClosed | Raised when questlog menu was closed.
Refreshed          | Raised when new day started or `IApi.ForceRefresh()` was called.

## Work with quests

### Add custom quest

```cs
var quest = new CustomQuest();

quest.Name = "meet_marlon"; // This is important!
quest.BaseType = QuestType.Location
quest.Title = "Meet with Marlon";
quest.Description = "Enter the Adventurer Guild east of mines and meet with Marlon.";
quest.Objective = "Go to Adventurer Guild";
quest.Trigger = "AdventureGuild";
quest.Cancelable = true; // Set this if you want this quest cancelable
quest.Reward = 500; // Set this if you want to set money reward (50g in this example quest)

// If you want to set next quests which will be added after this quest was completed
// These quests must be registered too in Quest Framework quest manager!
quest.NextQuests.Add("slay_bats");
quest.NextQuests.Add("bat_wing_trophy");
```

### Use quest offers

### Using ActiveState on custom quest

ActiveState allows you define quest state in simple way and also doesn't need call `this.Sync()` instead of work with dummy quest state. (Sync method is called automatically at end of update cycle)

For use active state fields on your custom quest type use class `ActiveState` as state type and then define properties on your class (property type must derive class `ActiveStateField`) with attribute `ActiveState`. QF automatically detects these properties as active state fields and initializes them. These properties is synchronized with state in store (state ready for write to savefile or ready to sync via network in multiplayer).
 
 **Automatic active state field(s) initialization**
```cs
using QuestFramework.Quests;
using QuestFramework.Quests.State;

namespace QuestEssentials
{
    class EarnMoneyQuest : CustomQuest<ActiveState>, IQuestObserver
    {
        public int Goal { get; set; }

        [ActiveState]
        public ActiveStateField<int> Earned { get; } = new ActiveStateField<int>(0);

        public bool CheckIfComplete(IQuestInfo questData, ICompletionArgs completion)
        {
            if (questData.VanillaQuest.completed.Value || completion.String != "money" || completion.Number1 <= 0)
            {
                return false;
            }

            // Update the state. No call `this.Sync()` needed
            this.Earned.Value += completion.Number1;
        
            return this.Earned.Value >= this.Goal;
        }
        /* ... */
    }
}
```
You can define more active fields than one in this way.

**Manual active state field(s) initialization**

```cs
using QuestFramework.Quests;
using QuestFramework.Quests.State;

namespace QuestEssentials
{
    class EarnMoneyQuest : CustomQuest<ActiveState>, IQuestObserver
    {
        public int Goal { get; set; }

        /* 
         * Give name for your active state field via constructor is needed, 
         * because name can't be fetched from property name by reflection 
         * (manual way doesn't use reflection)
         */
        public ActiveStateField<int> Earned { get; } = new ActiveStateField<int>(0, "Earned");
        
        protected override ActiveState PrepareState()
        {
            // Watch your active state field in overriden `PrepareState` method
            return base.PrepareState().WatchFields(this.Earned);
        }

        public bool CheckIfComplete(IQuestInfo questData, ICompletionArgs completion)
        {
            if (questData.VanillaQuest.completed.Value || completion.String != "money" || completion.Number1 <= 0)
            {
                return false;
            }

            // Update the state. No call `this.Sync()` needed
            this.Earned.Value += completion.Number1;
        
            return this.Earned.Value >= this.Goal;
        }
        /* ... */
    }
}
   ```
   You can define more active fields than one in this way. (Method `WatchFields` on `ActiveState` class instance supports propagate more active state fields via `params`.)

### Use custom texture&colors

```csharp
// In this context we work with QF managed api on SMAPI Mod class instance
CustomQuest quest = new CustomQuest("myQuest");

quest.Texture = this.Helper.Content.Load<Texture2D>("assets/my-quest-texture.png");
quest.Colors = new QuestLogColors() 
{
    TitleColor = 4,
    TextColor = 4,
    ObjectiveColor = 1,
}

managedApi.RegisterQuest(quest);
```
