# How to define a Custom Fish-Tank

To customize your Fish-Tank, your can use the `Fish Area` field.  
The Fish Area is a [Rectangle](https://github.com/Leroymilo/FurnitureFramework/blob/main/doc/Structures/Rectangle.md) **in pixels** that defines which part of the sprite the fishes will be able to swim in.

Don't forget to use a [Layer](https://github.com/Leroymilo/FurnitureFramework/blob/main/doc/Furniture.md#layers) so that there's a layer of glass in front of the fishes.
