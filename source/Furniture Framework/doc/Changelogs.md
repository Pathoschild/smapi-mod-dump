# 2.0

Big internal rework, changes to the Furniture definition Format:

- Token {{variant}} changed to {{ImageVariant}}.
- Added {{ModID}} token, mod UniqueID no longer prepended to avery Furniture id.
- Merged "Indoors" & "Outdoors" into "Placement Restriction" to match vanilla Furniture format.
- Nested "X" and "Y" fields of "Seats" elements inside a "Position" field.
- Complete rework of all "Depth" fields.

### 2.1.2

Fixed a small bug with slots on beds.

### 2.1.3

Fixed bugs.

## 2.2

Added Custom Description and Configurable Files Including.

## 2.3

Added support for Fish-Tanks.  
Added field "FF" in `Furniture.modData` to help with compatibility in other mods.

### 2.3.1

Fixed an issue with included files (duplicate furniture skipped even when an included pack is disabled)

### 2.3.2

Added "Max Size" field (integer vector) for slot to define a maximum size for Furniture placed in this slot.  
Fixed an issue with Rugs rotations (changed `Furniture.updateRotation` from postfix to prefix).  
Added "Bed Type" field ("Double" or "Simple") because double beds can't be placed in un-upgraded Farmhouse and simple beds cause issues on upgraded Farmhouse (spouse and respawn).
