# Creating a content pack

ðŸ’¡ **This documentation is a work in progress!**

## Complete example

See [`OrnithologistsGuild/assets/content-pack`](https://github.com/greyivy/OrnithologistsGuild/tree/main/OrnithologistsGuild/assets/content-pack) for a complete example.

Note that the mod has two build in content packs. All other content packs must be added to the game's `mods` folder with the prefix `[OG]` in the folder name.

## `manifest.json`

[Create your manifest](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Modder_Guide/APIs/Manifest) as usual. Use prefix `[OG]` in your mod's name.

Add the following to your `manifest.json`:

```json
"ContentPackFor": {
    "UniqueID": "Ivy.OrnithologistsGuild"
}
```

## `content.json`

All content packs require a `content.json` file in their root.

| Key               | Description                                |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `FormatVersion`   | Always `1`                                 |

## Weight system examples

### Winter forest birds

- Spawn globally, but are somewhat rare
- Common at Hopper feeders with Fruit, somewhat rare at Platform feeders with Fruit
- Slightly more common in Winter in the `forest` [biome](#using-the-biomes-system)
- Significantly less common in Summer
- Do not spawn in `desert` and `void` [biomes](#using-the-biomes-system)

```json
{
    "BaseWt": 0.05,

    ]
}
```

### Vanilla Stardew Valley birds

Replicates the vanilla bird logic.

- Spawn globally and are very common
- Visit at all feeder types with all food types
- Do not spawn after 3 PM
- Do not spawn in Desert, Railroad, or Farm locations
- Do not spawn in Summer

```json
{
    "BaseWt": 0.5,
    "FeederBaseWts": {
        "Hopper": 0.25,

# Creating a static perch on a map

Mod authors can add static perches to their maps. Birds will naturally land and roost on them!

Set **map** property `Perches` to a value in the following format:

`x y zOffset type` where `x` and `y` are tile coordinates, `zOffset` is a pixel offset on the Z axis to position a bird on the perch and `type` is currently always `0` (roost perch type). Multiple perches can be specified with a `/` separating them.

## Examples

### Adding two roost perches

Adds two roost perches at `(10,56)` and `(5,17)` with pixel a Z offset of `-18` pixels.

```json
{
    "Perches": "10 56 -18 0/5 17 -18 0"
}
```

# Using the biomes system

Biomes allow birds from all sources to spawn conditionally on vanilla maps *and* maps added by mods. For example, a mod author can add a desert themed map and have all desert birds spawn naturally.

Instead of spawning birds conditionally based on `LocationName`, we'll use `Ivy.OrnithologistsGuild/LocationBiome`. See [weight system examples](#weight-system-examples).

## Specifying biomes on a custom map

Mod authors can specify biomes on their own maps using the `Biomes` map property. The value should be a list of biomes seperated by a `/`.

For example, a map that is both a `forest` and a `wetland` biome would use `forest/wetland`.

If no biomes are specified, the `default` biome will be applied and a general set of birds will spawn.

## List of biomes

- `default` (unspecified biome)
- `void` (unhospitable biome)
- `farm`
- `forest`
- `city`
- `ocean`
- `wetland`
- `desert`
- `island` (not yet implemented)

Custom biome names can be used as well.
