It's festivus in Pelican Town! Celebrate the feast of the Winter Star with a little extra novelty in multiplayer.  
Someone unfortunate enough to have Vincent as a Secret Friend? Put some quality stone under the tree to go with that clay.  
Crushed everyone else in the egg hunt? Give them the straw hat so they'll forgive you when you do it again next year.  
Really just give everyone an Unmilled Rice Juice and wave goodbye to another productive year.

![](https://i.imgur.com/vjDXCIH.png) Gift other players (almost!) anything you like: but no tools!  
You can give anything like hats, clothes, rings, items, swords, hammers, furniture, beds, crafting machines, ...  
Squeeze up to 999 of any item in a gift at once to spread that holiday cheer.

Gift-wrapped presents will give a modest bonus to friendship with villagers, in addition to whatever's inside.  
You can't gift villagers anything you couldn't normally: no tools, no item stacks, no furniture!
