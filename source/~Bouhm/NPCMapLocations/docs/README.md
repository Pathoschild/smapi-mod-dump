**NPC Map Locations** is a [Stardew Valley](http://stardewvalley.net/) mod which shows the
locations of NPC and farmers on the map page and on a minimap, and makes the map positioning much
more accurate to the game.

## Install
1. Install the latest version of [SMAPI](https://smapi.io).
2. Install [this mod from Nexus Mods](http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/239).
3. Run the game using SMAPI.

## Use
### For players
Open the in-game map to see the positions for all NPCs, horses, players, and buildings. The map is
redrawn to match the in-game layout and positioning much more closely, and the player position will
also be much more accurate. The map will change for each season automatically, and adjusts
tracking automatically for larger custom map sizes. The map supports custom NPC outfits automatically.

While the map is open, press `TAB` (or `Y` on a controller) to show the mod options. You can
show/hide characters automatically based on various criteria (e.g. after they're talked to, when in
same location, within a certain distance, quests and/or birthdays, etc). 

You can optionally enable a minimap. You can move it by holding `CTRL` + right-click on the minimap,
then dragging it to the new position.

### For mod authors
See the [author guide](author-guide.md) for more info.

## Configure
### Global settings
The mod creates a `config/global.json` file in its mod folder the first time you run it, and a
separate file for each save. You can open those files in a text editor to configure the mod.

These are the available settings (most configurable through the in-game menu _except_ the key bindings):

## FAQs
* **Why do I see duplicate villagers on the map with UI Info Suite or Foxyfficiency?**  
  UI Info Suite and Foxyfficiency have a feature to show villagers, and as a result having it
  installed along with this mod will show duplicate villagers. To continue using this mod, there
  are options in UI Info Suite and Foxyfficiency to disable just the NPC tracking (look at the
  respective mod pages for more info).

* **Why does the game freeze or show a black screen on Linux/macOS?**  
  You can [update or reinstall Mono](https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable) to fix that.
  Mono is a SMAPI prerequisite on Linux/macOS.

* **Does the redrawn map work with map recolors?**  
  Yep, the mod has compatibility patches included for most of the popular recolors.

* **Does the mod support custom locations/NPCs?**  
  Yes, but the mod adding the custom locations/NPCs needs to tell NPC Map Locations how to handle
them. See the [author guide](author-guide.md) for more info.

## Compatibility
Compatible with Stardew Valley 1.5+ on Linux/macOS/Windows, both single-player and multiplayer.
The mod is compatible with **lots** of NPC/map mods with futureproofing.

**In multiplayer, the mod will only work if the host player has it installed.**
