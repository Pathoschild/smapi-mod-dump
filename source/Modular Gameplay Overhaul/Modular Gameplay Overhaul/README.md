## About this mod

This mod is a compilation of overhaul modules, each targeting a specific gameplay component or mechanic. Together, the modules complement each other to create a "Vanilla+" experience.

The modular nature of this mod allows users to cherry-pick features to their liking, while also preserving the deep native integration required between individual modules. This reduces the amount of code redundancy and improves code maintainability.

This mod is the culmination of over a year of work. Please take the time to read the descriptions before asking questions.

## Current Modules

The available modules are listed below. **Please read this page carefuly in its entirety.** Modules can be toggled on or off in the title screen via GMCM. Each module is itself highly configurable, and will be added to the GMCM menu if enabled. Some modules require specific enabling/disabling instructions you should pay attention to. These requirements will be mentioned below.

All modules should be fully multiplayer and splitscreen-ready so long as all players have it installed. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, none of the modules are Android-compatible. Please refer to each module's specific documentation page for further details and compatibility information.

- **[Professions](Modules/Professions)** is the original and largest module. It overhauls all the game's professions with the goal of supporting more diverse and interesting playstyles. It also introduces all-new Prestige mechanics for very-late game save files, as well as exciting new Super Abilities for combat professions.

- **[Arsenal](Modules/Arsenal)** is the newest and second largest. It overhauls various aspects of both melee weapons and slingshots so as to diversify combat and provide viable alternatives to the ubiquitous sword. Included are all-new enchantments, weapon combos and one new weapon type, as well as novelty features for making legendary weapons feel truly legendary. NOTE: If enabled on an existing save, your existing items will not be affected unless you run the command `margo revalidate_items`. If you then disable the module, you should run the same command again to revert your items back to vanilla status. **If you don't, and the StabbySwords option was enabled, your game will freeze when you try to use a Stabbing Sword.**

- **[Rings](Modules/Rings)** overhauls underwhelming rings, with the main emphasis being on the Iridium Band. It also introduces Gemstone Music Theory, which draws inspiration from real-life Music Theory to provide a more interesting and balanced form of combining many rings. It also adds new crafting mechanics providing a more natural progression for ring development.

- **[Ponds](Modules/Ponds)** is a complement to the new Aquarist profession. It allows Fish Ponds to remember the qualities of raised fishes, scales roe quantity and quality with population, and a few other interesting features.

- **[Taxes](Modules/Taxes)** is a complement to the new Conservationist profession. It introduces a simple yet realistic taxation system as an added challenge and end-game gold sink. Because surely a nation at war would be all over your juicy farm income.

- **[Tools](Modules/Tools)** is a simple mod which allows for chargeable resource tools and customizable farming tools. It also extends the available pool of tool enchantments.

- **[Tweex](Modules/Tweex)** is the final module, and serves as a repository for smaller tweaks and fixes to inconsistencies not large enough to merit a separate module.

Please note that only the Professions and Tweex modules are enabled by default.

## Installation & Update

1. Extract the downloaded archive file into your local mods folder.
2. Start the game once with SMAPI to generate a config file.
3. Use the Generic Mod Config Menu to enable the desired modules.
4. Restart the game for changes to take effect.

As with any mod, always **delete any previous installation completely** before updating. If you'd like to preserve your config settings you can delete everything except the configs.json file.

**The use of Vortex or other mod managers is not recommended for Stardew Valley.**
