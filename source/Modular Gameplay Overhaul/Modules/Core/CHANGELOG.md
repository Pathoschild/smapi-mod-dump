# Core Changelog

## 4.2.2

### Changed

* GMCM page links moved to the top of the page for better UX.

## 4.2.1

### Changed

* Updated Chinese translations by [Jumping-notes](https://github.com/Jumping-notes).

### Fixed

* Fixed GMCM issue in handheld systems removing all spaces from Dynamic List options.

<sup><sup>[ðŸ”¼ Back to top](#core-changelog)</sup></sup>

## 4.2.0

### Added

* Added new config presets which can be found in the "optionals" folder. The compatibility files have also been moved to this folder.
* Added Status Effect framework, previously from CMBT module.

<sup><sup>[ðŸ”¼ Back to top](#core-changelog)</sup></sup>

## 4.1.5

### Fixed

* GMCM Module Selection setting now translates correctly.
* Fixed an edge case where hitting Save on the menu would reset any DynamicList options that are **not** on the current menu page. Turns out GMCM doesn't quite behave in the way I expected, so had to implement a workaround.

<sup><sup>[ðŸ”¼ Back to top](#core-changelog)</sup></sup>

## 4.1.3

### Fixed

* Fixed GMCM list text boxes being limited to 13 characters.
* Fixed an edge case in SpanSplitter where splitting would fail if a substring is empty. This fixes an issue with Ridgeside's Fairy Needle weapon, which, for some reason, has no description.
* Fixed some translations. Added Chinese translation of GMCM strings by [Jumping-notes](https://github.com/Jumping-notes).

<sup><sup>[ðŸ”¼ Back to top](#core-changelog)</sup></sup>

## 4.1.2

### Changed

* Config options with custom logic now only trigger when the value changes. This avoids unecessarily triggering every single validation logic when saving via GMCM.

<sup><sup>[ðŸ”¼ Back to top](#core-changelog)</sup></sup>

## 4.1.1

### Changed

* Switched from storing menu initialization flag in custom data.json to storing it in config.json. This eliminates the extra file and allows users to set the flag as they wish. This also prevents users who carry over their config from seeing the initial module selection again. Honestly idk why I didn't do this in the first place.

### Fixed

* Fixed Debug objects being instantiated in Release mode.

<sup><sup>[ðŸ”¼ Back to top](#core-changelog)</sup></sup>

## 4.1.0

### Added

* Added dynamic list options to the GMCM, which means that any list config settings that previously had to be changed manually (like `CustomArtisanMachines`, `StabbingSwords`, `TaxRatePerBracket`, etc.) can now be changed in the menu in-game. With this, all settings are now available in the menu.

### Changed

* The GMCM is now self-generating (thanks to atravita for the idea and reference code). This does unfortunately mean that absolutely all translation keys for the menu have changed (sorry translators.)

<sup><sup>[ðŸ”¼ Back to top](#core-changelog)</sup></sup>

## 4.0.1

### Added

* Added a warning to re-enable modules if checksum validation fails.

<sup><sup>[ðŸ”¼ Back to top](#core-changelog)</sup></sup>

## 4.0.0

### Added

* Debug mode now highlights every segment of the Royal Serpent.

### Changed

* Sprite assets organized into subfolders.
* Moved OutOfCombat MonsterTakeDamagePatcher to this module, where it should have been.

<sup><sup>[ðŸ”¼ Back to top](#core-changelog)</sup></sup>

## 3.1.4

### Added

* Re-added debug framework, which disappeared completely from the repo, apparently back in version 1.0?.

### Changed

* Now uses `IntegrationRegistry` from updated Shared lib.

<sup><sup>[ðŸ”¼ Back to top](#core-changelog)</sup></sup>

## 3.1.3

### Changed

* Rolled back dependency updates due to conflicts with AtraCore.

### Fixed

* Added missing translations. Improved some Chinese translations, thanks to xuzhi1977.

<sup><sup>[ðŸ”¼ Back to top](#core-changelog)</sup></sup>

## 3.1.2

### Added

* The config menu will now detect if gamepad mode is enabled and choose a controller-friendly layout. The detection only happens when the menu is constructed, and will not change dynamically if the player switches between gamepad mode and mouse/keyboard mode.
* Added Korean GMCM translations by [Jun9273](https://github.com/Jun9273).
* Added Chinese GMCM translations by [Jumping-notes](https://github.com/Jumping-notes).

## 2.5.0

### Changed

### Fixed

<sup><sup>[ðŸ”¼ Back to top](#core-changelog)</sup></sup>

## 2.4.0

### Added

* Debug mode now also shows NPC names and current health in the case of monsters.

### Fixed

<sup><sup>[ðŸ”¼ Back to top](#core-changelog)</sup></sup>

## 2.3.0

### Added

* Added income and property tax information to the API.

### Added

* Moved the API interface from the shared library to the mod source.

### Changed

### Removed

<sup><sup>[ðŸ”¼ Back to top](#core-changelog)</sup></sup>

## 2.2.1

### Fixed

* Checksum validation now happens on Saving instead of Saved, allowing it to persist immediately instead of only on the next day.

<sup><sup>[ðŸ”¼ Back to top](#core-changelog)</sup></sup>

## 2.2.0

### Added

* Added StackableBuff class.
* Added Status Effect framework. Each status condition has a neat correponding animation.
    - **Bleeding:** Causes damage every second. Damage increases exponentially with each additional stack. Stacks up to 5x. Does not affect Ghosts, Skeletons, Golems, Dolls or Mechanical enemies (ex. Dwarven Sentry).
    - **Burning:** Causes damage equal to 1/16th of max health every 3s for 15s, and reduces attack by half. Does not affect fire enemies (i.e., Lava Lurks, Magma Sprites and Magama Sparkers).
    - **Chilled:** Reduces movement speed by half for 5s. If Chilled is inflicted again during this time, then causes Freeze.
    - **Freeze:** Cannot move or attack for 30s. The next hit during the duration deals double damage and ends the effect.
    - **Poisoned:** Causes damage equal to 1/16 of max health every 3s for 15s, stacking up to 3Ã—.
    - **Slowed:** Reduces movement speed by half for the duration.
    - **Stunned:** Cannot move or attack for the duration.

### Changed

* Debug mode is now a toggle.
