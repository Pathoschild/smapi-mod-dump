[size=6][font=bebas_neuebook]Overview[/font][/size]

This module is an extensive overhaul of vanilla professions and skills, and makes up the core of the overhaul. Almost every profession has been reworked to be an equally unique and attractive choice, targeting a specific style of gameplay, many of which were simply not viable in vanilla (e.g., ranching). And while it is not guaranteed that an "optimal" path does not exist, the main goal is to create opportunities for diversified or themed strategies as well as engaging new gameplay mechanics. Gone are the [s]boring[/s] uninspiring +X% sell price bonuses, and in their stead we introduce bomberman mining, thief/assassin combat, truly epic sharpshooting and even Slime taming. The new professions are meant to scale with player, provide new end-game objectives and steer the player towards new playstyles.

By popular demand this module also introduces an immersive (and completely optional) [b][color=#ffff00]Prestige[/color][/b] system, which will eventually allow the player to obtain all professions and open up skill progression to level 20. Also added are unique special abilities for each combat profession, with accompanying new visual and sound effects.

This module was inspired by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/3959191?tab=about+me]Enai Siaion[/url]'s excellent [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1137]Ordinator[/url] mod for Skyrim, and borrows many ideas (and a few assets) from the likes of [url=https://www.leagueoflegends.com]League Of Legends[/url], [url=https://diablo2.blizzard.com]Diablo[/url] and the classic [url=https://ro.gnjoy.com/index.asp]Ragnarok Online[/url]. It also includes profession icons by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/users/38784845]IllogicalMoodSwing[/url] ([b]please visit and endorse [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/4163]Profession Icons Redone[/url]![/b]).

Integrations are provided out-of-the-box for several popular mods. See the [b]Compatibility [/b]section below for details.

This module is safe to enable or disable mid-save. All profession perks will be applied retroactively. However, please note that disabling this mod will not change your skill levels or acquired professions, so make sure to manually reset your skills and professions back to vanilla standards [b]before[/b] disabling, using provided console commands.

[*][b][color=#D9EAD3][img]https://gitlab.com/daleao/sdv-mods/-/raw/main/Modular%20Overhaul/Modules/Professions/resources/assets/sprites/loose/harvester.png[/img]﻿ Harvester (Lv5)[/color][/b] - 10% [color=#ffff00](20%)[/color] chance for extra yield from harvested crops.
[size=1][spoiler]Yields an equivalent 10% monetary bonus to vanilla on average, but also provides value if you choose not to sell raw crops.[/spoiler][/size][*][b][color=#D9EAD3][img]https://gitlab.com/daleao/sdv-mods/-/raw/main/Modular%20Overhaul/Modules/Professions/resources/assets/sprites/loose/agriculturist.png[/img]﻿ Agriculturist (Lv10)[/color][/b] - Crops grow 10% [color=#ffff00](20%)[/color] faster. Grow best-quality crops organically without fertilizer.
[size=1][spoiler]Allows harvesting iridium-quality crops, normally only possible with Deluxe Fertilizer. The chance is half of that with Deluxe Fertilizer, which means that fertilizers are definitely [b]not[/b] obsolete.[/spoiler][/size][*][b][color=#D9EAD3][img]https://gitlab.com/daleao/sdv-mods/-/raw/main/Modular%20Overhaul/Modules/Professions/resources/assets/sprites/loose/artisan.png[/img]﻿ Artisan (Lv10)[/color][/b] - Artisan machines work 10% [color=#ffff00](25%)[/color] faster. Machine output quality can be as good as input ingredient quality.
[size=1][spoiler]Output quality is based on Farming level. The lowest possible quality is 2 stages below the input quality, and the highest possible quality is 1 higher than the input quality. For reference, the chance to preserve quality at level 10 is 30%. Note that the quality preservation perk is tied to the Artisan player, while the production time and quality promotion perks are tied to the machine itself; in other words, only Artisans themselves can preserve the quality of ingredients, but they can do so on any machine, whereas any non-Artisan player can benefit from faster production and quality upgrades, so long as they use a machine crafted by an Artisan player (ownership requirements can be turned off in the configs).[/spoiler][/size][*][b][color=#D9EAD3][img]https://gitlab.com/daleao/sdv-mods/-/raw/main/Modular%20Overhaul/Modules/Professions/resources/assets/sprites/loose/rancher.png[/img]﻿ Rancher (Lv5)[/color][/b] - Befriend animals 2× [color=#ffff00](3×)[/color] quicker.

Increase value of animals at high friendship.
[size=1][spoiler]At max friendship animals are worth 2.5x their base price, instead of vanilla 1.3×. If [b]Animal Husbandry[/b] is installed, gestation following insemination is also 2× [color=#ffff00](3×)[/color] faster.[/spoiler][/size][*][b][color=#D9EAD3][img]https://gitlab.com/daleao/sdv-mods/-/raw/main/Modular%20Overhaul/Modules/Professions/resources/assets/sprites/loose/producer.png[/img]﻿ Producer (Lv10)[/color][/b] - Happy animals produce 2× [color=#ffff00](3×)[/color] as frequently. Produce worth 5% more for every full barn or coop.
[size=1][spoiler]Note that happiness, or mood, is [b]not[/b] the same as friendship. Also note that this will [b]not[/b] allow certain animals (i.e., cows and chickens) to produce more than once per day. Bonus produce value also applies to artisan goods derived from animal products (such as cheeses, mayos and cloth), honey (bees are animals too), and meat from Animal Husbandry or PPJA Fresh Meat. Also also note that only deluxe buildings can be considered full, and only barns and coops owned by the Producer will be considered (ownership requirements can be turned off in the configs). There is no limit to this bonus value.[/spoiler][/size][/list]

Progressively identify forage of higher quality.
[size=1][spoiler]All foraged items will have the same deterministic quality, providing immediate inventory convenience. However, that quality will initially start out at silver, and progress to iridium as you gather foraged items. Unlike vanilla this perk will also apply to hoed forage (such as Winter Root, Snow Yams and Ginger), Coconuts shaken off palm trees, and mushrooms produced by Mushroom Boxes, but only if the cave owner (i.e., the host player) has the profession. It will likewise apply to crafted [b]Mushroom Boxes[/b] and [b]Mushroom Propagators[/b], if either of those mods is installed.[/spoiler][/size][*][b][color=#D0E0E3][img]https://gitlab.com/daleao/sdv-mods/-/raw/main/Modular%20Overhaul/Modules/Professions/resources/assets/sprites/loose/scavenger.png[/img]﻿ Scavenger (Lv10)[/color][/b] - Location of forageable items revealed. Occasionally detect buried treasure. [color=#ffff00]Time freezes during Scavenger Hunts.[/color]
[size=1][spoiler]Whenever you enter a new outside map there is a chance to trigger a short Scavenger Hunt for hidden buried treasure. Follow the purple HUD arrow to find the treasure and dig it up (using a Hoe) within the time limit to obtain a reward. The larger your win streak the better your odds of obtaining rare items, and also of spawning more forageables items. You can optionally configure the HUD arrows to only appear when holding a key (LeftShift by default). This will also highlight forageable currently on-screen for your convenience.

Normal trees can drop [color=#ffff00](twice as much)[/color] hardwood.
[size=1][spoiler]Bonus tree growth works as a global buff; i.e., all trees in the world are affected as long as any player in the session has this profession, and the effect will stack for all additional online players that share this profession. The hardwood bonus is inherited and uchanged from vanilla.[/spoiler][/size][*][b][color=#D0E0E3][img]https://gitlab.com/daleao/sdv-mods/-/raw/main/Modular%20Overhaul/Modules/Professions/resources/assets/sprites/loose/tapper.png[/img]﻿ Tapper (Lv10)[/color][/b] - Tappers are cheaper to craft.

[size=1][spoiler]Analogous to Scavenger. Tracks all mining nodes and mineral forages off-screen with a yellow pointer, [b]revealed[/b] ladders, shafts and panning spots (when outside) with a green pointer. Whenever you are in the mines there is a chance to trigger a short Propsector Hunt for hidden stone treasure. Follow the purple HUD arrow to find the correct stone within the time limit and break it up to obtain a reward. The larger your win streak the better your odds of obtaining rare minerals or artifacts, and also of spawning additional resource nodes in the mines. Successful completion of a hunt automatically reveals a ladder. You can optionally configure the HUD arrows to only appear when holding a key (LeftShift by default). This will also highlight mineral nodes and other tiles of interest currently on-screen for your convenience.

Exploded rocks yield 2× [color=#ffff00](3×)[/color] as much coal.
[size=1][spoiler]This aims to provide a new style of mining while attempting to compensate for the lack of coal without the vanilla Prospector profession.[/spoiler][/size][*][b][color=#FFF2CC][img]https://gitlab.com/daleao/sdv-mods/-/raw/main/Modular%20Overhaul/Modules/Professions/resources/assets/sprites/loose/demolitionist.png[/img]﻿ Demolitionist (Lv10)[/color][/b] - Bomb radius +1. Exploded rocks yield 20% [color=#ffff00](40%)[/color] more resources.
[size=1][spoiler]This aims to improve the bomberman style of mining while attempting to compensate for the lack of Geologist and Gemologist professions from vanilla. You can also manually detonate bombs by holding down the Mod Key (default LeftShift); these bombs will not detonate until you release the key. As an optional bonus, the Pyromaniac inside of you will [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nlJuwO0GDs]Get excited![/url] when hit by an explosion.[/spoiler][/size][*][b][color=#FFF2CC][img]https://gitlab.com/daleao/sdv-mods/-/raw/main/Modular%20Overhaul/Modules/Professions/resources/assets/sprites/loose/gemologist.png[/img]﻿ Gemologist (Lv10)[/color][/b] - Progressively identify gems and minerals of higher quality. Crystalariums work 25% [color=#ffff00](50%)[/color] faster.
[size=1][spoiler]Analogous to Ecologist. All gems and minerals mined from nodes have a fixed quality, starting at silver and increasing to iridium as you mine. Please note that this bonus will only apply to gems or minerals that have been either physically mined, or produced by Geode Crushers owned by the Gemologist. Crystalariums and geodes opened by Clint will [b]not[/b] receive quality upgrades. The exception to this is Crystalariums already in production, which will all receive an equivalent quality upgrade whenever the owner reaches a quality milestone. The production time bonus for Crystalarium is likewise tied to the owner, and therefore only Crystalariums crafted by the Gemologist will receive that perk (ownership requirements can be turned off in the configs).[/spoiler][/size][/list]

Fully-expended tackle effects linger on the fishing rod. [color=#ffff00]Fish are another 0.5% more valuable for every unique max-sized species caught[/color][color=#ffff00].[/color]
[size=1][spoiler]Legendary fish are instead worth 2.5% bonus to fish sell price, including Extended Family. Lingering tackle effects last for 40 uses (same as regular tackle), effectively doubling tackle duration, but more importantly, allowing different tackles to be used together. [b]The same tackle effect cannot stack with itself.[/b][/spoiler][/size][*][b][color=#CFE2F3][img]https://gitlab.com/daleao/sdv-mods/-/raw/main/Modular%20Overhaul/Modules/Professions/resources/assets/sprites/loose/aquarist.png[/img]﻿ Aquarist (Lv10)[/color][/b] - Fish pond max capacity +2 [color=#ffff00](+4)[/color].

They will only produce roe, unless another mod patches their FishPondData. An optional Fish Pond Data patch is provided in the downloads page. Extended families are also considered legendary, and can be raised in the same pond as their kin if [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/articles/1264]PNDS[/url]﻿ module is enabled.

Can trap higher-quality [color=#ffff00](highest-quality) [/color]haul.
[size=1][spoiler]All trapped fish can have quality up to gold [color=#ffff00](iridium)[/color]. Chance depends on fishing level (same formula as forage). The Crab Pot recipe is unchanged from vanilla.[/spoiler][/size][*][b][color=#CFE2F3][img]https://gitlab.com/daleao/sdv-mods/-/raw/main/Modular%20Overhaul/Modules/Professions/resources/assets/sprites/loose/luremaster.png[/img]﻿ Luremaster (Lv10)[/color][/b] - Baited Crab Pots can produce 2× [color=#ffff00](3×)[/color] per day.

Clean the Valley's waters to merit tax deductions and villager favor. [color=#ffff00]Tax deductions accumulate 50% faster.[/color]
[size=1][spoiler]Every 100 (configurable) junk items collected will earn you a 1% tax deduction the following season (max 25%, also configurable). What a "tax deduction" means depends on whether [b][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/articles/1265]TXS[/url]﻿[/b] module is enabled; if it is enabled, a tax deduction works as you would expect, reducing your overall amount due. If this module is not enabled, then a tax deduction works as a % value increasing to all items shipped in the bin. If you quality for a deduction you will receive a formal mail from the Ferngill Revenue Service on the first of the season informing your current deduction rights. If using Automate, you may want to play with the `TrashNeededPerTaxBonusPct` setting to something more reasonable.[/spoiler][/size]﻿[/list]

[size=1][spoiler]Press the Mod Key (default LeftShift) to cycle between equipped ammos. Squishy ammo (i.e., fish, fruits, veggies, and slime) and explosive ammo canot be recovered. Can also equip Slime as ammo, which causes a slow debuff to enemies.

[size=6][font=bebas_neuebook]Prestige[/font][/size]

If enabled, the [url=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/The_Sewers#Statue%20Of%20Uncertainty]Statue of Uncertainty[/url] is replaced by the [b]Statue of Prestige.[/b]

[center][img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1303/images/14470/14470-1670909907-508003492.gif[/img]﻿[/center]
Instead of changing your profession choices, the Statue of Prestige will reset your level 10 skills back to level 0, for a price. When a skill is reset you keep every profession you've previously acquired (yes, including level 5), and you now get to level up again to take up another profession. Re-leveling can become progressively harder, or easier, depending on your settings. By default, a reset will also cause you to forget all associated recipes, but this can also be turned off.

For this incredible service, the Statue of Prestige will charge, by default, 10,000g the first time, 50,000g the second, and 100,000g the third and last time, although the costs can also be configured. As you reset and acquire new professions your progress will be reflected on the skills page menu, either by a new colorful star, or by a growing ribbon, depending on your settings.

After three resets, or once you have acquired four stars, or the ribbon has reached its fourth stage, the level cap for the corresponding skill is raised to 20, allowing you to continue to develop your tool proficiency, max health, etc. Other perks of higher levels include better odds of higher-quality crops, fishes and forage, a larger fishing bar, more berries foraged per bush, and longer-lasting Limit Breaks (see below). On top of that, at levels 15 and 20 you will be able to choose a profession to [b]prestige[/b]. A prestiged profession grants improved perks or, in some cases, entirely new ones.

[center][img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1303/images/14470/14470-1670908621-2008495626.gif[/img]﻿[/center]
Only after all possible skills have had their level cap raised will the Statue of Prestige resume it's old behavior, by allowing you to change your prestige choices, for a modest fee of 20,000g (also configurable).

The entire Prestige system is optional. It may be turned off at any time, but keep in mind that doing so mid-game will not cause you to lose any already acquired professions, nor will it have any immediate effects on your skill levels. However your skill levels will be reduced to the regular cap of 10 the next time the save is loaded.

All custom mod skills based on SpaceCore are compatible with the skill reset feature, but will not out-of-the-box have their level cap raised above the regular 10. For skill mod developers, if you wish to provide prestiged professions you can do so by registering your skill via the provided [b][url=https://gitlab.com/daleao/sdv-mods/-/blob/main/Modular%20Overhaul/API/IModularOverhaulApi.cs#L57]API[/url][/b].


[size=6][font=bebas_neuebook]Limit Breaks[/font][/size]

In addition to their regular perks listed above, every level 10 profession in the Combat skill tree also grants a unique [b][url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak]Limit Break[/url][/b]. This special ability must be charged by performing certain actions during combat. You can track the current charge by the HUD bar labeled "L".

Note that, though all combat professions can be acquired via skill reset, [b]only one Limit Break can be registered at any time[/b]; if the Combat skill is reset, you will be asked the moment you choose your next profession whether you wish to keep or replace your current Limit Break. The four Limit Breaks are:

[size=1][spoiler]Charged by scoring critical hits. Charge amount depends on critical power.

Charmed Slimes grow in size and power, seek out other enemies and provoke their attention.
[size=1][spoiler]Slime scale up factor is random, up to twice the original size. Slimes gain a proportional damage and health boost. If defeated, engorged Slimes break up into smaller baby Slimes. There is also a low chance to convert Slimes to a special variant. If "Prismatic Jelly" special order is active, low chance to convert the Slime to prismatic variant. Nearby Big Slimes explode immediately. Charged by being touched by Slimes, by defeating Slimes and Big Slimes, or by shooting Slime ammo with a Slingshot.[/spoiler][/size][/list]

After all possible skills have had their level cap raised, the Statue of Prestige will let you switch between the four Limit Breaks for free, though a cost can be configured.

Limit Breaks, as with the Prestige system, is another optional feature, and can be disabled entirely in the mod settings.

[size=6][font=bebas_neuebook]Frequently Asked Questions[/font][/size]

[b]Do Ecologist and Gemologist professions count forages/gems acquired before the profession?[/b]
   ﻿No.

[b]Do Artisan/Producer/Aquarist and similar professions based on ownership of a machine or building, apply retroactively to machines/buildings that have already been crafted/built before acquiring the profession?[/b]
   ﻿Yes.

[b]Can Luremaster and Conservationist work together?[/b]
   ﻿Luremaster only affects Crab Pots [b]with[/b] bait. Conservationist only affects Crab Pots [b]without [/b]bait.  
  
[b]Can I obtain all prestige professions simultaneously?[/b]
   ﻿No, sorry. Making tough choices is part of this mod's design.  
   ﻿You can cheat them in with console commands if you really want (`profs add -p all`).  
  
[b]Can I obtain all Limit Breaks simultaneously?[/b]
   ﻿Given that these are [b]active[/b], and not passive, effects, the answer should be an obvious "no".

[b]What do Legendary Fish produce in Fish Ponds? How long do they take to multiply?[/b]
   ﻿They will obey whatever is set for them in the [url=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Fish_Pond_data]Fish Pond Data[/url] file.  
   ﻿By default they don't multiply, have no quests, and only produce Roe.  
   ﻿This can be changed to whatever you like by using Content Patcher to target FishPondData.  
   ﻿An example file is offered under the Optional downloads as a template for this.  
   ﻿It adds several valuable items to the possible produce list of each Legendary Fish, but doesn't change their spawn time or population quests.  
   ﻿You may customize this file to achieve your preferred behavior.

[b]I don't like X profession. Can I pick and choose between modded and vanilla professions?[/b]
   ﻿No. Professions are all or none. Each profession requires changing vanilla code at several different locations, and making all of them toggle-able would require a lot of work and unnecessary complexity, which makes the code slower and opens up more possibility for bugs.

[b]Will you add compatibility for Deluxe Grabber Redux?[/b]
   ﻿No. Since that machine touches a lot of different things that would involve many professions, that would require a lot of work I don't want to do as I'm not a fan of that mod.

[b]Will you increase the level cap beyond 20?[/b]
   ﻿No. That would be entirely meaningless. At level 20 your stamina consumption from tools is exactly zero (note that the Tools module actually prevents that, setting 0.1 as the floor value to prevent the Efficient enchantments from being completely useless). The only other benefits would be some more berries collected per bush, and a ridiculously large fishing bar, which already glitches out in the mid-20's. The main benefit of skill levels are crafting recipes and professions, and obviously there's nowhere left to grow in that regard.
