# TOLS Changelog

## 3.0.1

### Added

* Re-added the tool-specific enchant command.

### Fixed

* Fixed Master enchantment on tools other than Fishing Rod still increasing Fishing level by 1, and also not showing up as green in the skills page. Idk why ConcernedApe didn't just make it an `addedFishingLevel` to begin with.

## 3.0.0

### Fixed

* Fixed a vanilla bug that occurs when attempting to harvest fiber that is not ready for harvest, with a Haymaker scythe, and caused an infinite fiber exploit.

<sup><sup>[ðŸ”¼ Back to top](#tols-changelog)</sup></sup>

## 2.5.0

### Added

* Added Radioactive tool upgrades and Volcano Forge Upgrading.
    * Once the Volcano Forge is unlocked, you can use it to complete your tool upgrades. You will need the same amount of metal bars, and a handful of Cinder Shards to ignite the Forge. In exchange, there is no labor cost, and most importantly, the result is instantaneous (no waiting around for 2 days).
    * This is the only way to obtain the Radioactive upgrade level, since Clint is not a fool to mess around with radioactive substances.
    * If Moon Misadventures is intalled, the Mythicite upgrade level also can only be obtained by this method.
    * Includes Radioactive and Mythicite textures compatible with [Grandpa's Tools](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/8835).
* Added option to reward experience for using the Watering Can.
* Added option to prevent refilling the Watering Can with salt water (enabled by default).
