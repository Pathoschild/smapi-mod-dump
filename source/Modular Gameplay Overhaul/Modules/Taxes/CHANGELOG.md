# TXS Changelog

## 3.1.4

### Changed

* Default annual interest increased to 72% (was previously 12%). The original value was chosen based on common IRL values. However, IRL, years are >3x longer, and debts are payed over several years, which allows compound interest to take effect. In-game, the 12% was too low to cause any noticeable impact. So I multiplied 12 by 3, and then again by 2 to get 72%. That should give a larger incentive to clear your debts.
    * The change will not affect player's who keep their old configs. I suggest players increase this config setting to taste.

### Fixed

* Fixed debt not being collected when reloading.

## 2.5.5

### Changed

* You can now choose what percentage of each business expense is tax-deductible.
  YOU MUST EITHER DELETE YOUR CONFIGS, OR MANUALLY CHANGE THE FOLLOWING VALUES FROM "true/false" to "1.0/0.0":
  * DeductibleAnimalExpenses
  * DeductibleBuildingExpenses
  * DeductibleSeedExpenses
  * DeductibleToolExpenses
* Now actually uses ConservationistTaxBonusCeiling setting from PRFS, instead of setting it to 100%.

<sup><sup>[🔼 Back to top](#txs-changelog)</sup></sup>

## 2.5.0

### Fixes

* Fixed an issue caused by ephemeral caching of overnight tax calculation between 1st and 2nd day of the season. If the player reset the game during the 2nd day of the season, calculations would be lost. These calculations are now persisted in mod data to prevent this issue.

### Fixed

<sup><sup>[🔼 Back to top](#txs-changelog)</sup></sup>

## 0.9.0 (Initial release)

### Added

* Added the option to deduct business expenses from taxable income. Business expenses can include building constructions, tool-related costs, animal-related costs and seed purchases. You may also specify individual objects by name that should be tax-deductible.
* Added new console commands for directly setting season income and outstanding debt.

### Changed

* Tax brackets now work progressively, as in real life; i.e., instead of applying only the highest applicable bracket, income is actually split into each applicable bracket. The result is less taxes paid overall.

### Fixed

* Fixed an issue where debited amount would not actually reduce the player's money when they didn't have any before sleeping. The debit now happens when the day starts, *after* the previous day's earnings have been added to the player's balance.
* Fixed a typo in introduction letter (english).
* Fixed a translation objects not being converted to strings.
