# SLNGS Changelog

## 2.5.6 <sup><sup>[ðŸ”¼ Back to top](#slngs-changelog)</sup></sup>

### Fixed

* Fixed a small tooltip overflow issue with the Basic Slingshot.
* Fixed EnableSpecialMove config not doing anything.
* Removed some leftover debugging Alerts.

## 2.5.5 <sup><sup>[ðŸ”¼ Back to top](#slngs-changelog)</sup></sup>

### Fixed

* Explosive ammo now slays Mummies as expected.

## 2.5.3 <sup><sup>[ðŸ”¼ Back to top](#slngs-changelog)</sup></sup>

### Fixed

* Fixed another possible Null-Reference, this time in Slingshot tooltip draw.

## 2.5.1 <sup><sup>[ðŸ”¼ Back to top](#slngs-changelog)</sup></sup>

### Fixed

* Fixed possible Null-Reference in Slingshot stat creation.

## 2.5.0 <sup><sup>[ðŸ”¼ Back to top](#slngs-changelog)</sup></sup>

### Added

* Topaz Enchantment now actual does something if CMBT module is disabled (previously required CMBT module to do anything).
* Added option to display the current primary ammo in the item's sprite (enabled by default).

### Changed

* Archery Integration:
    * Bows can no longer receive gemstone enchantments. Instead, the focus shifts to Arrow Enchantments, as intended by PeacefulEnd.
    * Effectively, Bow ammo slots are equivalent to gemstone sockets, which means they can receive up to 2 gemstone effects (with the Rascal profession) based on the arrows that are equipped. The downside is that the player is required to craft enchanted arrows. The upside is that arrows can be swapped freely, unlike enchantments.
    * Arrow Enchantments will in turn resonate with Infinity Bands ([CMBT](../Rings)), as would other gemstone enchantments. Resonance bonuses apply even while the resonating arrow is in secondary ammo slot. If the resonating arrow is in the primary ammo slot, however, it's damage is also amplified by the resonance.
    * Diamond-tipped arrows give 2 random enchantment effects, but do not resonate.
    * If Rebalance option is enbled, arrow base damage also increases the bow's minimum damage, instead of only the maximum.
    * Rebalanced the Archery Starter Pack (new Misc. download). This adds the remaining gemstone arrow varities, making it required for all of the above. **I will not support any other content packs.**
* Changes to make regular slingshots more similar to Archery bows, and distinct from Melee Weapons:
    * Slingshots can now equip gemstones, including Diamonds and Prismatic Shard. Diamonds are particularly strong. Prismatic Shards are nukes.
    * Slingshots can no longer receive gemstone enchantments. As with bows, they now receive bonuses based on equipped gemstones. Clearly this is a huge nerf for Slingshots in the end-game, but also a huge buff in the early game, which I think is worth the trade.
    * Gemstone bonuses are now additive instead of multiplicative, which is in most cases an overall buff.
    * Again, resonances from Infinity Bands still apply as expected, and buff the gemstonee's raw damage when equipped as primary.
    * Diamonds give 2 random enchantment effects, but do not resonate.
    * Prismatic Shards give all enchantment effects simultaneously.

### Fixed

* ColorCodedForYourConvenience now works without WPNZ module. Also works for weapons from Archery Starter Pack.

## 2.4.0 <sup><sup>[ðŸ”¼ Back to top](#slngs-changelog)</sup></sup>

### Added

* Added compatibility for [Archery](http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/16767).
    * Bows can receive gemstone enchantments. The number of allowed gemstones must be configured manually using the SocketsPerBow setting.
    * Due to the nature of the Archery framework, Prismatic Shard enchantments are not allowed. This is not a technical limitation, but a design choice, given that bows can already be configured with customizable special attacks, and that arrows can receive custom enchantments. It simply would not make sense to add Prismatic Shard enchantments on top of that.
    * Bows are not affected by the following features:
        - They do not have ammo modifiers like slingshots do, but rather actual damage stats. So the EnableRebalance option does nothing. I may rebalance specific content packs, such as the Starter Pack. But obviously, expect this to receive the same treatment as the Weapon Rebalance from WPNZ.
        - Bows can naturally critical hit, so the EnableCriticalHits option, likewise, does nothing.
    * Anything else not listed here should be compatible, including Auto-Selection and Slick Moves.

### Fixed

* Fixed a typo that made fire speed bonuses from rings barely noticeable. They now work as advertised.
* Improved the special move animation (again). Hopefully the last time.
* Infinity Slingshot swipe effect is now hot pink, like the other Infinity weapons if WPNZ is enabled with Infinity+1 option.
* Can no longer stun enemies from afar by using the special move as a projectile is about to hit an enemy.
* Fixed Archery bows incorrectly triggering the Slingshot special move.
