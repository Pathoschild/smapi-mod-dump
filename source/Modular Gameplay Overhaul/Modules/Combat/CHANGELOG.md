# CMBT Changelog

## 4.0.2

### Added

* You can now immersively switch Galaxy Sword and Infinity Blade between Defensive and Offensive types by taking them to the Sand Pillars.

### Changed

* The animation for acquiring the Blade of Dawn now actually shows the sword's transformation, and plays a new "holy" sound effect.
* The sound effect also plays when praying to the Yoba altar.
* When acquiring a Galaxy weapon, instead of floating upwards, the weapon now floats downwards as if being gifted by the heavens. A small touch, but looks infinitely better.

### Fixed

* Fixed sword type not being set correctly.
* Hero Quest should now auto-complete if started with all conditions already met.

## 4.0.1

### Changed

* Mammonite enchantent now has a hard cap of 1000 HP or less. To avoid cheesing boss monsters in SVE or other expansions, there is now a chance of success of `remaining HP / 1000`. For regular monsters with a few hundred HP, this makes a negligible difference, and the enchantment will still trigger with 90%+ success chance. But for boss monsters, the chance will be near zero close to the hard cap of 1000 HP, and gradually increase as the boss approaches death.

### Fixed

* Reduced number of hashing calls due to monster status effects, which should give a neglible performance boost.
* Fixed an issue with Mammonite enchantment not actually rewarding the correct amount of gold.

### Added

* Blade of Dawn and Infinity weapons now also emit a small light, around half of a Small Glow Ring.

    * **Jinxed** debuff will now prevent the use of special moves.

* All Legendary-tier weapons now use the same title color (no more hard-to-read gold text in Blade of Dawn). Default color is set to the same as Masterwork.

### Removed

* Removed the Artful enchantment for both Melee and Ranged. Remnants of it have been added to Infinity weapons.

## 3.1.10

### Changed

* Changed the hold-up messages displayed upon obtaining a Dwarvish blueprint. Added new variations for when the player has or has not obtained the Dwarvish Translation Guide.
    * The following translation keys have been added:
        * `weapons.sword`
        * `weapons.club`
        * `weapons.dagger`
        * `blueprint.found.first.unknown`
        * `blueprint.found.first.known` 
        * `blueprint.found.next.unknown`
        * `blueprint.found.next.known`
        * `blueprint.found.need_guide`
    * The following translation keys have been removed:
        * `blueprint.found.first`
        * `blueprint.found.local`
* Changed the color the Dwarvish blueprint sprite to a rusty orange, more reminiscent of other Dwarven items.
* Lowered default difficulty settings back to more reasonale values:
    * Enemy HP x2.5 -> x1.5
    * Enemy Damage x2 -> x1.5
    * Enemy Defense x2 -> x1.5
    * Enemy Spawn Chance x2 -> x1
* `GetBlueprint` command is now available in release.

### Fixed

* Fixed weapon enchantments applying on-hit effects twice. This was effectively doubling the effects of Carving, Wabbajack and all weapon status effects.
* The type of weapon should now appear localized in hold-up messages.
* Fixed the `GetBlueprint` command, which wasn't working as expected.

<sup><sup>[ðŸ”¼ Back to top](#cmbt-changelog)</sup></sup>

## 3.1.9

### Changed

* Increased container spawn chance no longer applies in Skull Caverns.

### Fixed

* Virtue Proven message now uses I18n.

<sup><sup>[ðŸ”¼ Back to top](#cmbt-changelog)</sup></sup>

## 3.1.8

### Changed

* Default auto-selection border color changed from Magenta to Aqua.

### Fixed

* Fixed possible out-of-bounds exception in auto-selection draw.

<sup><sup>[ðŸ”¼ Back to top](#cmbt-changelog)</sup></sup>

## 3.1.7

### Added

* Added a new fail-safe in case Hero's Reward quest does not trigger. Should never happen, but hey, that's why they call it a fail-safe?

### Changed

* GetCustomItem command changed to GetBlueprint. For other items just use CJB Item Spawner.
* The auto-selection border now draws behind other elements in the UI, and emulated the shadow effect of the vanilla "current tool" highlight, giving it a much better "vanilla" feel.

### Fixed

* Fixed not taking damage when not holding a weapon or slingshot.

<sup><sup>[ðŸ”¼ Back to top](#cmbt-changelog)</sup></sup>

## 3.1.6

### Changed

* Steadfast enchantment changed.
    * **Old behavior:** adds `critRate * critPow * 100` to your base damage.
    *This resulted in higher average damage in almost every single case. Base damage was the only variable that could improve the value of crit. strikes over Steadfast, requiring the BiS weapons for the former to beat the latter. Crit. rate impacted both equally, meaning that building more crit. rate would never make crit. strikes more valuable than Steadfast. **I really hadn't given this one much thought.***
    * **New behavior:** adds `baseDamage * critPow * k` to your base damage.
    *Where k depends on the base crit. rate and crit. power of the weapon type. First, by removing the crit. rate scaling, we ensure that crit. strikes are more valuable than Steadfast in crit. rate-focused builds. Second, by scaling with base damage instead, we ensure that Steadfast is viable with any weapon, and doesn't suddenly fall off after aquiring the BiS weapons. The new formula finds a new niche in builds that focus on crit. power without crit. rate.*

### Fixed

* Fixed slingshot cooldown freezing when unequiped.

<sup><sup>[ðŸ”¼ Back to top](#cmbt-changelog)</sup></sup>

## 3.1.5

### Added

* Added `MonsterSpawnChanceMultiplier` config setting.
* Added to slingshots the pulse effect that other weapons have when their special cooldown ends.

### Changed

* Neptune Glaive can no longer be obtained before the Skull Key, thus preventing lucky players from bypassing the initial Mines grind.
* Wizard's special Blade of Ruin dialogue will now only occur once per day, so it will no longer prevent all other dialogues.
* Increased base difficulty settings:
    * Enemy HP x1.5 -> x2.5
    * Enemy Damage x1 -> x2
* Tweaked the mean and sigma values used for `VariedEncounters` config setting. Mean variation is now smaller and sigma is significantly narrower. This should keep enemy stats more in the realm of "reasonable" without too much crazy variability.
* Valor completion by streaking through the Mines now only works on Hard Mode. Reduced from 100 levels to 10-20-40 (depending on difficulty).

### Fixed

* Fixed slingshot special cooldown not applying correctly.

<sup><sup>[ðŸ”¼ Back to top](#cmbt-changelog)</sup></sup>

## 3.1.4

### Added

* Receiving your final Galaxy weapon will now also reward a free pair of Space Boots. They can still be purchased at the Adventure Guild, as always.

### Fixed

* Added translations for new chat notifications (missing JA, KO and ZH).
* Stabbing Sword special move will no longer clip through warps.
* Fixed error thrown when trying to get Galaxy weapon with Iridium Bar config set to zero.
* Fixed an issue where the player could not drift left or down using Slick Moves feature.
* Fixed Savage Ring buff slowing down attack speed instead of boosting it up.

<sup><sup>[ðŸ”¼ Back to top](#cmbt-changelog)</sup></sup>

## 3.1.3

### Added

* Added chat notifications for when a virtue point is gained. This should help to make it less cryptic.

### Changed

* Changed data key for each virtue trial to simplify logic. Added temporary transition code to SaveLoaded.

### Fixed

* Mayor shorts quest now correctly gives Honor points instead of Valor.

<sup><sup>[ðŸ”¼ Back to top](#cmbt-changelog)</sup></sup>

## 3.1.1

### Fixed

* Forgot to scale Garnet Node spawn back down to normal after debugging for 3.1.0.

<sup><sup>[ðŸ”¼ Back to top](#cmbt-changelog)</sup></sup>

## 3.1.0

### Changed

* [CON] Garnet Node is now merged into the main mod, so no longer requires a separate download.

<sup><sup>[ðŸ”¼ Back to top](#cmbt-changelog)</sup></sup>

## 3.0.2

Exodus from Nexus.

### Added

* You can now prove your Honor (+2 points) by returning the Mayor's Purple Shorts, as long as you don't troll him at the Luau or the Grange.
* You can now prove your Valor by digging 100 (or 50, on Easy difficulty) consecutive floors in the Mines without using Staircases.
* Added Virtue completion tags to several SVE events. Most of these are "mature events", so you will need that option enabled to benefit from this.
* You can now prove your Valor by reaching the Treasure Cave in the Crimson Badlands.

### Changed 

* Base Valor completion objective was changed back to Monster Eradication Goals. Someone pointed out that slaying monsters for the sake of slaying monsters is not exactly "courageous".
* Changed SVE's Treasure Cave chest reward from Obsidian Edge to Lava Katana.

### Fixed

* Wabbajack end-of-day cleanup should now run correctly.

<sup><sup>[ðŸ”¼ Back to top](#cmbt-changelog)</sup></sup>

## 3.0.1

### Fixed

* Fixed Piper's Slime ammo damage (increased from 5 to 10).

<sup><sup>[ðŸ”¼ Back to top](#cmbt-changelog)</sup></sup>

## 3.0.0

Merged WPNZ, SLNGS, RNGS and ENCH into the CMBT module. All of those modules essentially tackled different facets of combat, and WPNZ and SLNGS in particular shared many redundant patches and config settings. In that light, the unification streamlines a lot of the config schema and cuts down on the number of patches required.

Find the legacy pre-merge changelogs here:
* [CMBT](./resources/legacy/CHANGELOG_CMBT.md)
* [WPNZ](./resources/legacy/CHANGELOG_WPNZ.md)
* [SLNGS](./resources/legacy/CHANGELOG_SLNGS.md)
* [ENCH](./resources/legacy/CHANGELOG_ENCH.md)
* [RNGS](./resources/legacy/CHANGELOG_RNGS.md)

## Added

* Added enemy difficulty summands to config options and changed default config values for some multipliers.

## Changed

* Prismatic Shard ammo is no longer affected by Preserving Enchantment. That combination was broken AF.
* Improvements to the Blade of Ruin questline:
    * The player will now be prompted to pick up the Blade of Ruin immediately after taking the Gold Scythe, without need to interact with the Reaper Statue a second time.
    * After selecting to read any of the virtue inscriptions at the altar of Yoba, the player will now immediately be prompted to read a different inscription, until all 5 have been chosen. This should make it slightly more intuitive that all 5 dialogues must be seen to advance the quest.
    * The trials now display an objective text that should make it a bit more clear how to complete them (instead of simply "Prove your XYZ").
    * The town community upgrade now also counts towards the player's generosity.
    * The player's valor no longer depends on Monster Eradication quests. It's now a simple monster kill counter.
    * Tweaked the completion criteria for Generosity and Valor.
    * You can now offer a prayer to Yoba once a day to weaken the Blade of Ruin's curse by 20%, to a minimum of 50 points.
    * Slightly changed the flavor text when obtaining a Galaxy weapon and the Blade of Dawn.
* Blade of Dawn now also deals extra damage to shadow and undead monsters (vanilla Crusader effect, but weaker) and grants the effect of a small lightsource while held.
    * If you were not aware, the Blade of Dawn and Infinity weapons already all possess the ability to inflict perma-death on Mummies, replacing the vanilla Crusader enchantment.
* Blade of Dawn and Infinity weapon beams no longer cast a shadow.
* Lowered Wabbajack probability from 0.5 to about 0.309.

## Removed

* Removed temporary fixes for existing saves after previous changes to the Hero's Quest.
