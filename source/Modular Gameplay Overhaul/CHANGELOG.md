## Patch 4.1.3 Highlights

* Fixed GMCM list text boxes being limited to 13 characters.
* [CMBT]: Fixed an edge case that caused an error to be thrown with Ridgeside's Fairy Needle, which, for some reason, does not have a description.
* [CMBT]: Stabbing Swords are no longer persisted as such, to avoid the issue of the game freezing if the mod is removed abruptly.
* [CMBT]: Weapon Overhaul is now a hard requirement for both Stabbing Swords and Melee Combo Framework.
* [CMBT]: Removed the crit. boost given to daggers in vanilla.
* [CMBT]: Added new failsafes for Community Upgrades applying to farmhand Hero Quest.

## Patch 4.1.2 Highlights

* [CMBT]: Fixed issues with weapons stats being set incorrectly.
* [PRFS]: Fixed Null-Reference exception caused by `Monster.FindPlayer`.

<sup><sup>[ðŸ”¼ Back to top](#margo-changelogs)</sup></sup>

## Hotfix 4.1.1 Highlights

* Hotfix for all weapons being turned into swords when Combat module not enabled.

## Minor Release 4.1.0 Highlights

* The GMCM is now self-generating, which is awesome (for me) but does unfortunately mean that absolutely all translation keys for the menu have changed (sorry translators). The ZH and KO menu translations had to be discarded.
* Added dynamic list options to the GMCM, which means that any list config settings that previously had to be changed manually (like `CustomArtisanMachines`, `StabbingSwords`, `TaxRatePerBracket`, etc.) can now be changed in the menu in-game. With this, all settings are now available in the menu.
* [CMBT]: Made several minor improvements to animations and sound effects when acquiring Galaxy Blade / Blade of Dawn.
* [PRFS]: Fixed Aquarist bug causing it to always consider the `FishPondCeiling` setting instead of the actual number of constructed Fish Ponds.
* [PRFS]: Hopefully fixed an issue with CP skill level conditions not working at levels above 10.
* [PRFS]: Several PPJA dairy products are now also considered "animal-derived" for the Producer profession. The list of `AnimalDerivedProducts` has been added to the configs.
* Added compatibility for [More New Fish](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/3578).
    * [CMBT]: The Sword Fish weapon is now a Mythic-tier Stabbing Sword with scaling damage based on caught fish species.
    * [PRfS]: Tui and La can be raised in Fish Ponds with the Aquarist profession. They produce essence instead of roe.
    * [PNDS]: Tui and La can be raised together in the same Fish Pond, unlocking a low chance to produce Galaxy Soul.
