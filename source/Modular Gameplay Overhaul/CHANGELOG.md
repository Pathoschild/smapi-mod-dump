# MARGO Changelogs

This file contains a TL;DR of current version changes and hotfixes from across all modules. For the complete changelog, please refer to the individual changelogs of each module, linked [below](#detailed-changelogs).

## Patch 4.2.1 Highlights

* Fixed a GMCM issue in handheld systems.
* Updated translations. Minor typo fixes.

## Minor Release 4.2.x Highlights

* Added new config presets which can be found in the "optionals" folder.
* Moved the Status Effect framework to the Core module, so that other modules can continue to use it even if CMBT is disabled.
* [CMBT]: Added some flavor dialogue to Emily and Mr. Qi dropping some hints about the Infinity Band.
* [PRFS]: Added new Prestige mode options. You can now have Prestige Levels without needing to reset your skills a bunch of times. Or make it even harder by requiring full reset of **all** skills before unlocking Prestige Levels.
* [PRFS]: Overhauled the Oceanographer (Prestiged Conservationist) profession perk to better fit the profession's title.
* [PRFS]: Overhauled the Saboteur (Prestiged Conservationist) profession perk to better fit the profession's title.
* [PRFS]: Replaced the Aquarist profession's icon with that of fish Roe.
* Some adjustments to the API.
* Shaved off several mods from the curated list due to newfound incompatibilities.

**NOTE: This version is incompatible with XP Display. If you want to use that mod then DO NOT update. Please don't bother Shockah or I about this.**
