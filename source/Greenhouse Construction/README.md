# GreenhouseConstruction
A simple Stardew Valley mod that allows construction of additional Greenhouses.

# How to Use
Simply install the mod, making sure to have the dependencies installed as well.

## How to get another Greenhouse
To get a new Greenhouse, you must first have unlocked the Greenhouse on the Farm, either through the Community Center or through JojaMart. Once this is done, visiting Robin will let you build a Special Greenhouse for the materials listed below.

**Note: This building is meant to be expensive. Greenhouses are an incredibly useful building, and the cost reflects this.**

**Note: Material costs are subject to change through updates.**

## Material Cost
The Special Greenhouse costs the following to build:
* 100 Hardwood
* 300 Stone
* 50 Iron Bars
* 100,000 Gold (currency)

## Dependencies
This mod requires PyTK to function.

## Compatibility
This mod uses an image I made based off the vanilla Greenhouse appearance for the exterior of the building. As such, replacement mods will not have any effect on the exterior appearance. However, for the interior of the buildings I am pulling from the game's Greenhouse map, so mods that replace the interior of the Greenhouse through something like Content Patcher should be compatible. I make no promise that any particular mod is compatible, nor will I dedicate making the compatibility.

# Current Issues
* There is currently an issue where I do not know how to make the image in Robin's shop appear for the building, so for the time being the image in the shop is going to be a purple square.
* There seems to be a bug where players can enter the void around the Greenhouse Interior by walking out to left or right of the door and attempting to exit the Greenhouse, though I am unsure if this is the result of my mod or the custom Greenhouse mod I use.
