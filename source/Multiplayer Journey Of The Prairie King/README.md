Honestly, most of the work for this mod was the cleanup of the messy decompiled code that is the original version of this arcade game.
You can still find lots of non tidy parts in the code that i didnt get to/have to clean up. 

Feel free to dig around, create issues for bugs you have found, or even create a pull request if you found an issue that you wanted to fix personally. Also non feature PRs that just clean up code are alway appreciated.
