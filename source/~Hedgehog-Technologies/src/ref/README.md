# Reference Assemblies

The .dlls in this directory were generated using [JetBrains Refasmer tool](https://github.com/JetBrains/Refasmer).

I do not claim to be the owner or distributer of the original files, nor are these meant to be used in place of those. These were generated to allow myself to utilize them in github workflows to automate my build and release process.

If there is a problem with these being included in this public repository, please reach out to me to discuss it.
