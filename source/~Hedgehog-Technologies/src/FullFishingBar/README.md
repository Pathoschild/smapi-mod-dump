## Documentation
### Overview
When enabled, this mod will set the fishing mini game's "Bobber Bar" to take up the entire possible range.

You may be asking yourself, "why in the world would I want this when there are instant catch mods?"
Potential answers:
- Accessibility without totally breaking balance
  - Playing the fishing mini game can be very difficult for some players for reasons unintended by the original design
  - This mod helps to maintain some amount of balance without completely blowing out the fish economy
- Instant catch fishing takes a ridiculously small amount of time in-game
  - This mod allows you to take the normal amount of time that fishing would take out of a day
- Very obvious in multiplayer server if you are using instant catch mods
  - This mod helps you be a bit more covert about your fishing, allowing you to still appear to be fishing normally
  - You are still able to cancel the fishing mini game early to give the appearance of failing the mini game

### Config
