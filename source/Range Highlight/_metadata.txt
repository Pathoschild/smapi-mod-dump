       v4.2.0: new options: coalesing overlaps, sprinkler range, hide on motion
       
       * Added "Sprinkler Mod Compatibility" option.  The default ("more
         compatible") changes the way that sprinkler ranges are calculated so
         that it is likely that it will automatically be correct even if mods
         have changed the shape of sprinkler ranges (on either the existing
         sprinkler objects or new ones added by the mod).  This is a more
         expensive calculation, so there is an option to revert to the old
         behavior ("faster").
       
       * Added the "show overlaps" option (defaulting to true).  If this is
         disabled then overlapping range tiles of the same color will be
         converted into just one highlight tile of that color.  This is a
         relatively expensive operation; disabling this option may result in
         decreased performance and lag.
       
       * Added an option to hide the held item's highlight at the mouse location
         if the player has moved more recently than the mouse has moved.
         (Defaults to true)
