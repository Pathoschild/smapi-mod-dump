       fix bug in Better Junimos integration; version 3.6.1
       
       Previously, the junimo hut range was fixed when the integration was
       installed, which is annoying when it means that in-game changes to the
       configuration are not reflected until returning to the title screen, but a
       serious problem when using the "Junimos work for wages" option in Better
       Junimos.  When using that option, the range is initially a reduced range
       until the junimos have been paid.
       
       The range is now re-fetched before returning the highlight tiles for
       junimo huts.
