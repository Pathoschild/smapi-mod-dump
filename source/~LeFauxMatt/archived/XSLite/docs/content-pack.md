## eXpanded Storage Content Pack

### Contents

* [Overview](#overview)
* [eXpanded Storage](#expanded-storage)
* [Sprite Sheet](#sprite-sheet)
* [Context Tags](#context-tags)
* [Mod Data](#mod-data)

### Overview

All eXpanded Storage content packs must contain the following files:

- `manifest.json`
- `expanded-storage.json`
- `content.json`
- `assets/[SpriteSheet].png`
- `i18n/default.json`

#### manifest.json

`manifest.json` should specify this is a content pack for eXpanded Storage:

```json
{
  "ContentPackFor": {
    "UniqueID": "furyx639.ExpandedStorage"
  }
}
```

See more on manifest [here](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Modder_Guide/APIs/Manifest#Basic_examples)

#### expanded-storage.json

`expanded-storage.json` is used to define each storage:

```json
{
  "MyStorage": {
    
  },
  "AnotherStorage": {
    
  }
}
```

See more on the supported fields [below](#expanded-storage).

#### content.json

`content.json`
follows [Dynamic Game Assets format](https://github.com/spacechase0/StardewValleyMods/tree/develop/DynamicGameAssets#big-craftables)
for loading big craftables.

```json
{
  "$ItemType": "BigCraftable",
  "ID": "MyStorage",
  "Texture": "assets/MyStorage.png:0"
}
```

### Expanded Storage

Example content pack:

```json

  "StorageName": {
    "SpecialChestType": "None",
    "IsFridge": false,
    "HeldStorage": false,

<span id="handyheadphones">1.</span> I recommend
[Handy Headphones](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/7936) to listen to sounds available to play from
in-game.  
<span id="spritesheet">2.</span> Refer to the [Sprite Sheets](#sprite-sheets) section for arranging sprites correctly.  
<span id="storagecapacity">3.</span> Assign a capacity of at least one row (12) to avoid visual glitches.

### Sprite Sheet

A sprite sheet is a single image with frames that span horizontally and layers which span vertically.

#### Storage Dimensions

This sprite sheet is automatically used to determine the object's dimensions.

The width of the object is determined by `Total Image Width รท Frames`.

If `PlayerColor` is set to `false` the height of the object will be `Total Image Height`.  
If `PlayerColor` is set to `true` the height of the object will be `Total Image Height รท 3`.

#### Animation Frames

The left-most frame will always be the object at rest, and every frame after is animated when the storage is opened.

#### Player Color

When `PlayerColor` is set to `true` then the spritesheet must include three rows of sprites.

row | sprites
----|---------
1   | Default render when no player color choice is made.
2   | Base layer that will be rendered with the player's color choice.
3   | Drawn over the Base layer, but without the player's color choice.

### Context Tags

The game adds various [context tags](https://stardewcommunitywiki.com/Modding:Context_tags) to every item. The
recommended way to find what context tags are supported by which items is to
install [Lookup Anything](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/541) and enable
it's [ShowDataMiningFields](https://github.com/Pathoschild/StardewMods/tree/stable/LookupAnything#configure) option.
Then simply press `F1` while hovered over any item to find it's data.

Below are some of the more useful tags:

description     | tags
----------------|------
Category        | `category_clothing`, `category_boots`, `category_hats`, ...
Color           | `color_red`, `color_blue`, ...
Name            | `item_sap`, `item_wood`, ...
Type            | `wood_item`, `trash_item`, ...
Quality         | `quality_none`, `quality_gold`, ...
Season          | `season_spring`, `season_fall`, ...
Index           | `id_o_709`, `id_r_529`, ...

Additionally the following custom tags are supported:

tag                 | description
--------------------|-------------
`category_artifact` | Custom tag to select for any Artifacts.
`category_furniture`| Includes regular furniture items with this tag even though the game doesn't normally add it.
`donate_bundle`     | Selects any items that are missing from the Community Center Bundle.
`donate_museum`     | Selects any items that can be donated to the Museum.

### Mod Data

All items support a key-value store known as Mod Data. You can initialize values for your storage to integrate with
features from mods. This will only add the modData when the item is originally obtained or crafted, and it will not
override if a value already exists.

Of course Mod Data opens a world of possibilities depending on the mod, but here are a few notable examples:

key                                             | description
------------------------------------------------|-------------
`Pathoschild.ChestsAnywhere/IsIgnored`          | If `true` storage will be de-listed from Chests Anywhere .
`Pathoschild.ChestsAnywhere/Category`           | Storage will automatically be added to a Category.
`Pathoschild.Automate/StoreItems`               | If `"disable"` Automate will not store items in this storage
`Pathoschild.Automate/TakeItems`                | If `"disable"` Automate will not take items from this storage
