       Refactor code to remove unnecessary InputHelper and ReflectionHelper dependencies
       
       Removal of unnecessary dependencies on InputHelper and ReflectionHelper in multiple files is mainly done. These dependencies were seen in the different menu classes and service features like ChestFinder within the BetterChests Framework. Additionally, some classes were also updated to clean up and simplify the code, making it more maintainable.
