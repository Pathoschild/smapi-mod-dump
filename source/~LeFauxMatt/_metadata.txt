       Refactor menu management and fix Backpack Storage options
       
       The menu management has been updated to handle the current menu more uniformly across the codebase. Also, the inheritance of global storage options by Backpack Storage has been removed. Various issues with the backpack config, such as visibility in other menus and item placement restrictions, have also been addressed.
