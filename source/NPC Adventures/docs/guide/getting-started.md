## Compatibility

### Note for Android users

Beginning with version *0.11.0* there's an experimental support for Android SMAPI and Stardew Valley. There is list of known android issues:

- **HUD may be drawn at an incorrect position on some devices.** - If you have this problem, you can disable the HUD in configuration file. (Set `ShowHUD` to `false`)
- **The game may crash on Android 5.1 and older** - Can't fix it, because it's caused by SMAPI. Android SMAPI has an experimental harmony patching, you can report these crashes to @MartyrPher (developer of SMAPI for Android). Remember Android 5.1 and older is not officialy supported by this mod.
