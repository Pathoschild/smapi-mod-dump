# Quick_Start
When starting a new farm with this mod installed, it will automatically add a few items to your inventory when you start and add some gold. Below is the list of things which it adds by default.

These can be changed as needed by the player to turn certain features on and off in the provided config.json file. The amount of Coal, Wood, Stone, Fiber and Mixed Seeds can be changed to the players desire.

1. Coal x20
1. Wood x100
1. Stone x100
1. Fiber x50
1. Mixed Seeds x25
1. Chest
1. 250 Gold (This is in addition to the 500 you get when you start for a total of 750 gold to start a game).

**Note**: If you setup the configuration file to supply more than 400 or less than 1 of either: Coal, Wood, Stone, Fiber or Mixed Seeds, you will get the default values specified above and your configuration file will be overwritten with the default values for the appropriate item.

This is essentially a Fire and Forget mod. Once you start a farm you can remove this mod as it doesn't do anything else.
