       Fixing issue where an instance could get stuck in the SpriteMap even though it was nowhere else, preventing it from being purged or a new instance being created.
       Fixing issue where `sm gc start` would also purge sprite instances.
       Fixing the experimental inlining patch.
       Fixing memory/asset leak due to a reference to the resampling Task being inadvertently held via the InFlightTasks map (and thus the reference Texture2D being kept alive) - it is now a weak reference.
