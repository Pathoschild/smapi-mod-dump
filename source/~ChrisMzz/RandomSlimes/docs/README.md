# Random Slimes

Randomize colours of Slimes in the Mines, Skull Caverns, Quarry Mines, Woods or just about anywhere!

Woods are turned off by default, but everything can be customized through Generic Mod Config Menu.


This mod was made to be used along with [Slime Minerals](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/20930/), my other mod on Slimes adding more minerals to their drop pools.

## Install and Dependencies

1. Install the latest version of [SMAPI](https://smapi.io/).
2. Install [this mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/21320/).
3. Run the game through SMAPI (see [here](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Player_Guide/Getting_Started) for a guide on using SMAPI).

This mod does not have any dependencies, but can be used with [Generic Mod Config Menu](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5098) as stated in the description.
