# Trash 4 Elliott

A mod that gives you trash every time you're in the same area as Elliott, to make sure you always have the option of gifting him trash.

## Install and Dependencies

1. Install the latest version of [SMAPI](https://smapi.io/).
2. Install [this mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/18882/).
3. Run the game through SMAPI (see [here](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Player_Guide/Getting_Started) for a guide on using SMAPI).

This mod does not have any dependencies.

Due to the small amount of changes this brings to the game, you shouldn't run into any compatibility issues. This is the first mod I've written for Stardew Valley, so I may be coding some things wrong, sorry in advance for that.
