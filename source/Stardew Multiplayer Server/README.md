Stardew-Multiplayer-Server-Mod (Formerly funny-snek's Always-On-Server-for-Multiplayer)
Nexus Mods page: https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/20659/
This is a fork of the original Always-On-Server-for-Multiplayer mod for Stardew Valley, created by the awesome funny-snek.

Why the Fork?

It appears funny-snek may no longer be actively involved in the Stardew Valley modding community. To keep this valuable mod alive and potentially add future improvements, this fork has been created.

What's Included?

This fork provides the same functionality as the original mod, allowing you to run a dedicated headless server for Stardew Valley multiplayer, even when the host isn't actively playing.
