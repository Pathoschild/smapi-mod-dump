## How to Use

## Compatibility

This mod is made for Stardew Valley 1.6 using SMAPI 4.0. This mod will **not** work on versions prior to those mentioned.

Both singleplayer and multiplayer should work. If you are having issues with multiplayer, make sure you've downloaded at least version 1.0.1 of the mod as this included a multiplayer hotfix.

I have yet to test split screen, but did try to make it compatible.

This mod does not change fish spawns, so it *should* work with mods adding custom fish.

*Should* be compatible with mods that add custom bait and or hooks, I've yet to test this, but as long as the category for the custom item was set correctly, this mod should detect them.

This mod will **not** work with custom enchantments at the moment. I'm looking to add support for this in the future.

Likely to conflict with mods that try to do the same thing. Due to every option in this mod being configurable it should not be likely to cause issues, as you can simply turn the conflicting option off. Though, feel free to report any mods that do conflict by [opening an issue][gh-issues], updating the README and [sending a pull request][gh-pr] or [comment on the NexusMods page][nexus-comments].

## To Do

List of things I'd like to add at some point. However, this mod is mostly just for myself, to get fimiliar with C# and Stardew modding. I'm uncertain how many of these I'll actually end up doing.

- Configure how many fish to catch (update from catch double)
- Look into spawning multiple tackles
- Dutch translations
- Support for custom enchantments
- Refund stamina on maximum cast
- Skip fish catch animation
- Automatically loot caught fish and trash
- Skip treasure opening animation
