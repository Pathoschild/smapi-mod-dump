Version 1.1.0

- Fixed jellies not being able to be caught when the increase chance of catching fish option was enabled.
- Fixed bait and tackles randomly vanishing.
- Fixed certain bait not giving the extra fish, e.g. wild bait not catching two fish.
- Fixed XP amount being altered when adjusting difficulty.
- Fixed sliders having a bunch of digits after the decimal place.
- Added an auto cast keybind.
- Allow setting a minimum amount of fish required before the minigame gets skipped.
- Add a chance slider for "always perfect" and "instant catch treasure" for the minigame skip, meaning you can set a 50% chance of getting perfect.
- Adjust XP gain option, this will adjust the XP you gain when you change the difficulty, meaning you get more XP for higher difficulty.
- Change the rate at which a fish gets caught. If you'd like to catch fish 30% quicker while it's in the green bar, you can.
- Adjust the rate at which the fish escapes when it's not inside the green bar.
- An option to adjust the size of the green bar.
- Adjust the rate at which a treasure is caught when it's not inside the green bar.
- More specific options to alter what you catch. You can now set it to catch fish, rubbish and "other" items.
- Set the amount of fish you catch up to 100 fish.
- Alter the behaviour of fish quality to be clearer. The tooltips in GMCM will explain exactly how they work.
- Change how often a treasure is a golden treasure.
- Automatically loot the fish at the end of the minigame, rather than standing there holding a fish in your hand.
- Speed up most of the fishing animations.
- Completely rewrite attachment logic, now allow everything vanilla allows.
- Set an amount of bait to spawn.
- Infinite bait and tackle now no longer constantly reset the amount on every game tick. It now simply stops the consumption of your bait or wearing of your tackle.
- Overhaul of the GMCM menu, reorganised and reworded most settings to be more clear in meaning.
