[size=5][b]How to Use[/b][/size]

Once you've configured the mod the way you want, simply equip a fishing rod and start fishing!

[size=5][b]Compatibility[/b][/size]

This mod is made for [b]Stardew Valley 1.6[/b] using [b]SMAPI 4.0[/b]. This mod will [b]not[/b] work on versions prior to those mentioned.

Both [b]singleplayer[/b] and [b]multiplayer[/b] should work. If you are having issues with multiplayer, make sure you've downloaded at least version 1.0.1 of the mod as this included a multiplayer hotfix.

I have yet to test [b]split screen[/b], but did try to make it compatible.

This mod does not change fish spawns, so it [i]should[/i] work with mods adding [b]custom fish[/b].

[i]Should[/i] be compatible with mods that add [b]custom bait and or hooks[/b], I've yet to test this, but as long as the category for the custom item was set correctly, this mod should detect them.

This mod will [b]not[/b] work with [b]custom enchantments[/b] at the moment. I'm looking to add support for this in the future.

Likely to conflict with mods that try to do the same thing. Due to every option in this mod being configurable it should not be likely to cause issues, as you can simply turn the conflicting option off. Though, feel free to report any mods that do conflict by [url=https://github.com/Dunc4nNT/StardewMods/issues]opening an issue[/url], updating the README and [url=https://github.com/Dunc4nNT/StardewMods/pulls]sending a pull request[/url] or [url=nexus-comments]comment on the NexusMods page[/url].

[size=5][b]Translations[/b][/size]

English is the only language fully supported by me, and guaranteed to be up to date.

There are various languages that have translations available to download and use on NexusMods. Do note that these may not always be up to date, as I can't guarantee support for those languages myself.

If the language you'd like to see has no translation, or it's outdated, feel free to create your own translations and publish them as a mod translation on NexusMods. [b]Please only upload the translation file and nothing else.[/b] You can either upload it inside of a [u]Yet Another Fishing Mod/i18n/[/u] folder or as just the file. For extra information, take a look at the [url=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Translations]translation wiki[/url].

Due to me not being able to guarantee whether other languages are up to date, I prefer they be uploaded separately from this mod (so a mod translation on NexusMods). For players this means you'll have to look at the "Translations" tab on Nexus and check if the language you speak is on there. For translators this means you'll have to publish your translations on Nexus and publish updates after new releases yourself.

If you have a question regarding translations (whether it's about how to translate, how to upload them etc), feel free to contact me any way.

[size=5][b]Contact[/b][/size]

[b]In almost all cases[/b] please leave a comment on the [url=nexus-comments]NexusMods page[/url] detailing your issue. [b]Always[/b] include a link to your [url=https://smapi.io/log]SMAPI log[/url]. [b]Without[/b] this log it may be impossible for me to solve the problem you're having. If you prefer, you could send a DM on Nexus.

[b]Only after receiving permission[/b], may you try contacting me through Discord DMs or the SDV server (never.toxic). I likely won't respond otherwise.

[size=5][b]To Do[/b][/size]

List of things I'd like to add at some point. I'm uncertain how many of these I'll actually end up doing. List in no specific order.
[list]
[*]Rewrite enchantment logic.
[*]Allow for custom enchantments.
[*]Add a transpiler for catching fish in the mines. Currently it's just vanilla settings, so you'll mostly catch rubbish.
[*]Look into fish probability more in depth, currently if you just enable catching "Other", you won't catch jellies, and you'll catch rubbish in certain cases.
[*]For spawning bait and tackles, allow switching them without having to remove them from your rod.
[*]Option to apply fishing related buffs, such as luck and fishing.
[*]Refund stamina on max cast option.
[*]Gradually learn catching fish, so say after catching 5 of a certain fish the amount of time it takes to catch the next one decreases, all the way till it's instant.
[*]Allow requiring a certain amount of perfect catches before the minigame gets skipped.
[*]Split animation skip up into separate options.
[*]Add a slider to change animation speed (say from vanilla speed, up to 100% speed increase)
[*]Per fish override settings, e.g. have red snappers never appear or change difficulty for that fish specifically.
[*]Dutch translations.
