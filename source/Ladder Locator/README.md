This mod for Stardew Valley will mark the stones which will spawn a ladder or shaft to a lower level. If you can't see any marking it simply means you have bad luck and no stone will generate a ladder or shaft. Just clear some stones until the RNG is in your favor and the marks will eventually appear.
