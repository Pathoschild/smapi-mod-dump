YOU CAN GET THE MOD AT [NEXUS MODS](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/21050)

**PLEASE READ THE CONFIG OPTIONS!!!**

**How it works:** Just click whatever you want and it will select the correct item for it, the action will be performed at the same time as your click, like you were holding that item from the beggining, if the item is not found nothing happens. The items  dont need to be on your hotbar, if it is in your inventory, it will work.

**Now it works with Tractor Mod (Kinda)**
   ï»¿It will behave the exact same way as it already does, the only difference being that, when you are in a Tractor, the tools will insta swap whenever it detects something, so no need to click.
   ï»¿It wont swap to Hoe, because otherwise you would be tilling all the soil whenever you move, so you have to switch manually if you want to do it.
   ï»¿And as I already said, it will work the same way as the mod already does, and that means that any interactions the Tractor Mod has with tools, that are not in the vanilla game, it will do nothing, example: Usign Scythe to harvest Forageables, you will have to swap manually.

I just started playing the game and wanted a mod like this but i didnt found any, so i made it ðŸ˜….
