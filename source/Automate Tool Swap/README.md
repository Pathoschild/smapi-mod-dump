**You're viewing a file in the SMAPI mod dump, which contains a copy of every open-source SMAPI mod
for queries and analysis.**

**PLEASE READ THE CONFIG OPTIONS!!!**

**How it works:** Just click whatever you want and it will select the correct item for it, the action will be performed at the same time as your click, like you were holding that item from the beggining, if the item is not found nothing happens. The items dont need to be on your hotbar, if it is in your inventory, it will work.  
  
**Mod Config Options:** (You can change it with the  [GenericModConfigMenu](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5098)ï»¿ (RECOMMENDED) or manually in the config.json file)  
*underlined is default*  

-   **"Toggle Mod Keybind"** - CapsLock (The keybind to toggle the mod on or off.)
-   **"Tool Swap Keybind"** - LeftMouseButton (The keybind to switch between tools (suggested: same keybind for breaking items).)
-   **"Last Tool Keybind"** - MiddleMouseButton (The keybind to switch back to the last used tool.)
-   **"Tool Selection Mode"** -  Cursor/Player) (Choose how tools are switched: 'Cursor' uses the mouse pointer, 'Player' uses the player's orientation (If you are on controller, use this).)
-   **"Auto-Return to Last Tool"** - true/false (Automatically return to the previously used tool after swapping.)
-   **"Hoe for Empty Soil"** - true/false (Automatically switch to the hoe when clicking on empty soil.)
-   **"Pickaxe Over Watering Can"** - true/false (Prioritize using the pickaxe instead of switching to the watering can on dry soil.)
-   **"Pickaxe for Weeds"** - true/false (Automatically switch to the pickaxe instead of the scythe when clicking on weeds (fibers).)
-   **"Scythe for Grass"** - true/false (Automatically switch to the scythe when clicking on grass.)

**Now it works with Tractor Mod (Kinda)**  
	ï»¿It will behave the exact same way as it already does, the only difference being that, when you are in a Tractor, the tools will insta swap whenever it detects something, so no need to click.  
	ï»¿It wont swap to Hoe, because otherwise you would be tilling all the soil whenever you move, so you have to switch manually if you want to do it.  
	ï»¿And as I already said, it will work the same way as the mod already does, and that means that any interactions the Tractor Mod has with tools, that are not in the vanilla game, it will do nothing, example: Usign Scythe to harvest Forageables, you will have to swap manually  
  
I just started playing the game and wanted a mod like this but i didnt found any, so i made it ðŸ˜….  
There is probably some things i havent gotten to yet, but when i do i will add them
