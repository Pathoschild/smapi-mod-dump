# Skull-Cavern-Drill-Redux
A fork/spinoff of the original [Dwarven Drill/Skull Cavern Drill](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/6120?tab=description) mod combo by [S1mmyy](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/users/49462938) which aims to make the drill more usable in a regular game.

Adds a craftable drill that can be placed in the Skull Cavern to create shafts.

Note - the recipes for making the drill will not be unlocked until you reach Mining Level 8

## Items Added
- Dwarven Drill
- Dwarven Drill Core (ingredient for Dwarven Drill)
- Drill Casing (ingredient for Dwarven Drill)

## Improvements on Original Mod
- Attempted to balance the cost of the drill, as the original mod required a Dwarven Artifact which only comes from hoeing and geodes.
- Recipes actually give amounts shown (the recipe in S1mmyy's mod was broken due to a limitation with Json Assets)
- Components for the drill can be purchased from the Dwarf's shop (though it's cheaper to make them yourself)
- Fancy new homemade textures :)
