# Creaturebook
A framework that allows the player to have a notebook that includes info on various creatures added by content packs and to discover them.

# For mod users
As this mod is a framework, it wont do too much on its own. Download some content packs and have fun. For possibly-could-become-a-faq
kind of questions, please see user guide page first, then install it from ModDrop or Nexus later if you wish.
