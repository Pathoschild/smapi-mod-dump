## Inspiration & Credits 🌟
The development of the Real Clock mod was initially inspired by adverserath's ["Casual Life" mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/6011). The mod initially incorporated elements from the "Casual Life" codebase to adapt to Stardew Valley's 1.6 version. However, starting from version 1.2.0 of Real Clock, the code underwent a complete rewrite from scratch, making it entirely independent.
