# üì¶ Stack Everything Redux for Stardew Valley üå±

**Version:** 1.1.2

## Description:
**Stack Everything Redux** is an awesome mod that supercharges your item stacking experience in Stardew Valley! Say goodbye to clutter because now you can stack all sorts of items that normally don't stack, like **Furniture**, **Tackles**, and **Wallpapers**. Not only that, you can go beyond the default limit of 999 by customizing the max stack amount in the mod's settings.
‚Äî But wait, there's more! This mod also introduces a handy input method (**SHIFT+Right Click**) for easily selecting the amount you need when buying, crafting, cooking, or splitting stacked items. It's like magic for your inventory!

## Key Features üåü
- **Expanded Stacking Capability**: Stack items that are not stackable by default, including Furniture, tackle, and Wallpapers.
- **Modify Default Max Amount**: Customize the default maximum stack amount beyond 999 for improved item management.
- **Enhanced Input Selection**: Adds a convenient input method (SHIFT+Right Click) to select desired amounts when buying, crafting, cooking, or splitting stacked items.

## Installation:
1. **Download**:
   - Get the mod files from [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/22381).
2. **Install**:
   - Unzip the downloaded files into your Stardew Valley mods folder.
3. **Configuration**:
   - No additional configuration required. Enjoy enhanced stacking capabilities!

## How it Works:
This mod uses [Harmony](https://github.com/pardeike/Harmony) to:
- Replace `StardewValley.Object.maximumStackSize` to allow stacking up to 999.
- Improve stacking behavior for Furniture, tackle, and Wallpapers.
- Introduce input selection for easier item handling.

## Known Issues:
- Certain items like tools, hats, rings, boots, and weapons remain unstackable due to technical constraints.
