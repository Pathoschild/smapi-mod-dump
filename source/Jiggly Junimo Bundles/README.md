**Jiggly Junimo Bundles** is a Stardew Valley mod that jiggles a bundle if you have a matching
ingredient. It also adds a tooltip to your inventory that says if there's a bundle that needs this
ingredient.

## Usage
Press ESC to open up your inventory, open up the junimo page and page through the rooms with the
arrow icons, this will initialize the data so that tooltips function properly.

After this you will see a tooltip that says "Needed in bundle" if there's a bundle that needs that
particular item, it automatically filters items that you have already unlocked.
