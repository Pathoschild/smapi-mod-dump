----

This repository contains my SMAPI mods for Stardew Valley based on spacechase0's mods.
See the individual mods in the subfolders for documentation and release notes.

## Compiling the mods
Installing stable releases from Nexus Mods is recommended for most users. If you really want to
compile the mod yourself, read on.

These mods use the [crossplatform build config](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Pathoschild.Stardew.ModBuildConfig)
so they can be built on Linux, macOS, and Windows without changes. See [the build config documentation](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Pathoschild.Stardew.ModBuildConfig)
for troubleshooting.

### Compiling a mod for testing
To compile a mod and add it to your game's `Mods` directory:

1. Rebuild the solution in [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/) or [MonoDevelop](http://www.monodevelop.com/).  
   <small>This will compile the code and package it into the `Mods` directory.</small>
2. Launch any project with debugging.  
   <small>This will start the game through SMAPI and attach the Visual Studio debugger.</small>

### Compiling a mod for release
To package a mod for release:

1. Switch to `Release` build configuration.
2. Recompile the mods per the previous section.
3. Upload the generated `bin/Release/<mod name>-<version>.zip` file from the project folder.
