**Filtered Chest Hopper** is a blatent ripoff of a mod **Super Hopper** which lets you use hoppers to transfer items between chests.
But I added a filter function using chests beside the hopper.

## Install
1. Install the latest version of...
   * [SMAPI](https://smapi.io);
   * and [Automate](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1063).
3. Install [this mod from Nexus Mods](http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/21730).
4. Run the game using SMAPI.

## Use
place a hopper between two chests verticalky and it will start moving things from the chest above it to the chest below it.
Add items to the hopper inventory to act as a filter.

## Compatibility
Compatible with Stardew Valley 1.6+ on Linux/macOS/Windows, both single-player and multiplayer.
at least hopefully I don't know what I'm doing.
