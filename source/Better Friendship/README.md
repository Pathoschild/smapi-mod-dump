# Ditch the menus! See real-time gift suggestions based on the items in your inventory!

*Are you tired of constantly having to dig through multiple wiki pages or mod menus every time you want to give a villager a gift? Wouldn't it be easier if there was just a visual indicator of who can receive a gift and who you can talk to? You deserve [**Better Friendship**](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/10287)!*

## Other Mod
If you like this mod, consider checking out my other mod, [Better Ranching](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/859)﻿ (>15k endorsements)! I took a similar approach to try to remove some of the pain points from the ranching experience while still sticking to the spirit of the game.
