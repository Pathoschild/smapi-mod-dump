Fancy making the most of the unplantable space on your farm? Spotted the perfect site for a herb garden?  
Maybe you're just in it for the aesthetic! Build a garden bed anywhere you like on the farm, and grow your stuff in style.  
Build them in unique shapes, or fill in a big grassy patch with crops. Remember, though, you can't walk through them!

When you've made friends with Robin, she'll visit after early Summer and give you the basic recipes.

Build in lines, blocks, and around corners; build on grass, dirt, and sand! Style your farm like you've always wanted.

Garden beds break down at the end-of-season if they've grown old, but multi-season crops survive if they're fixed!
   
![](https://i.imgur.com/Gbi0Ju7.png) There's a few varieties to start off, each using different resources to craft, and with different lifespans.  
You'll find new themes appear as you reach different milestones while playing ...

### ![](https://i.imgur.com/d1sSW6N.png) Garden beds break with age
Garden beds will break down over time, similar to fences.  
You'll get a small refund on crafting ingredients when tearing down broken garden beds.  
Replace them by dropping in another of the same type. More expensive varieties will last for more seasons!

### ![](https://i.imgur.com/kyDOj12.png) Recipes always available
Don't fancy unlocking them over time? Get 'em all straight away!  
It might take away the magical wonder of discovery, but the choice is yours!

### ![](https://i.imgur.com/pDvC1Qz.png) Sprinklers enabled
Normally sprinklers can't be used for garden pots and raised beds.  
Sprinklers in or beside garden beds will water them for you if checked!

### ![](https://i.imgur.com/d1sSW6N.png) Usable in greenhouse
Set up plantable garden beds around the tiled floors of your greenhouse.  
Plants in them will grow just the same as any other!

### ![](https://i.imgur.com/kyDOj12.png) Usable in farmhouse
Build a garden inside your own home!  
Sprinklers placed on garden beds indoors will work just as if outside.

### ![](https://i.imgur.com/pDvC1Qz.png) Usable in farm buildings
Same as the last, you can build garden beds inside your sheds,
barns, as well as any other buildings on the farm!
