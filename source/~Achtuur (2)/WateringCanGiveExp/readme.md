# Watering Can Give Exp

In the Stardew Valley, gaining farming experience early on is based entirely on harvesting crops, even though most of your time is spent watering. This mod aims to change that, watering crops now gives a small amount of exp. In order to balance the total exp, harvesting exp gains are reduced by 75% (this can be disabled).

# Features

* Gain experience from watering soil
* For balance (can be disabled), reduce exp gained from crops by 25%
