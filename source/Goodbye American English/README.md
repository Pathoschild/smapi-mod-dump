### Goodbye American English ###

Changes American spelling to British spelling, this includes changing the season fall to autumn.

Also changes the game units to the metric system

I've tried to be as thorough as I can but I may have missed some changes, let me know if you spot anything and I'll fix it up.

## To install: ##
- Ensure SMAPI is installed
- Simply unzip the download file into your Mods folder

### NameReplacer ###
Version 1.4.0 introduced the ability to change the display names of any concession snack or object using the included NameReplacer.json file, think of this as an internal content pack. When entering name replacements make sure to put a comma at the end of each entry (except the last one). 

You can safely delete this file if you don't want to change any names. If you want to replace names but have deleted the file, simply create a new JSON file with the name "NameReplacer"

In Version 1.4.1, the NameReplacer.json will generate once the mod is run. Just ignore the file if you don't want to use it.

Input name replacements for objects are in the form "ObjectID":"O/Name/NameToReplaceWith" (first field is a capital O) e.g "272":"O/Eggplant/Aubergine". See https://stardewcommunitywiki.com/Modding:Object_data for object IDs

Input name replacements for concession snacks are in the form "SnackID":"C/Name/NameToReplaceWith" (first field is a capital C) e.g "0":"C/Cotton Candy/Fairy Floss"
