====================================
Stardew Druid - 1.6 Ready
====================================

40+ quests, 3 unique NPCs, 25+ abilities, 2000+ lines of dialogue and lore, Stardew Druid is a unique kind of expansion created to satisfy a desire for adventure.

This mod provides an alternative to early tool-based gameplay in the form of five schools of magic, which incorporate motifs and themes inspired by the Druids of antiquity!

The expansive questline starts with a custom NPC, the Effigy, located in the Farmcave, who will initially offer a new lesson or quest each day. The mod includes over ten epic boss battles to test your skills, with a range of configuration options to suit your playstyle. There are 21 lessons in total 

Your journey is recorded in the Stardew Druid journal, a custom journal menu that provides all the instruction and lore you could ask for. 

The mod works primarily though the use of the 'rite button', which is by default configured to keyboard.V, mouse.X4, mouse.X5 and controller.LeftShoulder.

For any mod support, discussion or feedback we recommend you join us on discord as opposed to posting on Nexus. Depending on timezones you might be able to get a response in under a minute!

-----------------------------------------
1. Rite of the Weald
-----------------------------------------
Weald is an old fashioned name for a woodland area, where ancient druids would perform ceremonies honouring the kings of Oak and Holly. This rite is about rewilding the empty spaces of the Valley and drawing on the life essence of the Earth.

Draw out the hidden bounty of the valley, add trees and grass to barren spaces, enhance the growth rate of crops, explode weeds, twigs, ore veins and trigger rock falls in the mines.

-----------------------------------------
2. Rite of the Mists
-----------------------------------------
The isle of mists is an important place in medieval sagas, and the residence of the Lady Beyond the Shore. This rite is about being a commanding presence with awesome displays of power and lots of lightning bolts.

Extract power from totem shrines, target scarecrows, rods and campfires for special functions, create high-yield fishing spots, and smite any obstacle in your way. 
Create monster rifts from ordinary candles for a bit of extra challenge and combat experience. 

-----------------------------------------
3. Rite of the Stars 
-----------------------------------------
Celestial bodies and formations were an important device of storytelling and calendar traditions. That's all very wonderful and this rite is about calling down little stars as fireballs.

Call a meteor shower and rain down fire from the sky with reckless abandon. Call an even bigger comet down when used in conjunction with abilities learned later.

-----------------------------------------
4. Rite of the Fates
-----------------------------------------
The fates are mentioned in many traditions of cultures that were adjacent to or inspired by the Fates of Greek mythology, and are the etymological root for faeries, fae and the like. This rite is about chance and destiny intertwined to produce random effects.

Meddle with the powers of the fates and to warp travel, dazzle enemies and villagers, power machines with essence and create anomalies in reality itself. 

-----------------------------------------
5. Rite of the Ether
----------------------------------------
The fifth element, ether, which inspires a lot of alchemical traditions, is considered to incorporate both the spiritual/divine and the material. The traditional progenitors and agents of this element were... Dragons.

Transform into a Dragon!

-----------------------------------------
+ Additional Features
-----------------------------------------
Gently caress your farm animals and neighbours with magic for soft friendship points each day.
Prove yourself in new, unique challenges that test your ability with each rite.
Encounter customised creatures with enhanced stats, cosmetics and behaviour.
Boost your output with the specialised autoconsume feature, unique to Stardew Druid!
Gain a dungeon delving companion, a treasure hunting friend and a gardener for your farm.

==========================================
SETUP
==========================================

Optimised for:  PC - Single Player - English
SMAPI 4.0.1 required
Generic Mod Configuration Menu recommended
Expected to work without issue on multiplayer and with popular content mods
2.0.1 is available on the Stardew Druid discord server as the last stable release for SDV 1.5.6

IMPORTANT:
1. In multiplayer, only the host can trigger some progression critical quests, including introductions to NPCs and challenges. This is to prevent NPC duplication amongst other things.
2. This mod is known to conflict with mods that make changes to the farmer animation/draw cycle, such as fashion sense. If the mod crashes when attempting to trigger a quest event, set 'disable cast hands' to true in the config to disable the cast/trigger animation and avoid potential conflicts.

-----------------------------------------
CASTING LOCATIONS
-----------------------------------------
Stardew Druid attempts, when possible, to detect appropriate maps for casting, namely outdoor locations and mineshafts.
No interior locations, except the Greenhouse in limited capacity, enable the player to reach the otherworld to cast rites.
Some expansion mods may have exterior maps with names and properties that Stardew Druid is unable to detect, such as "Expansion_cliffside_resort".
DeepWoods mod is the only Map expansion mods that Stardew Druid has optimised for at this stage.
As expected Winter is a sad time for Rite of the Earth due to seasonal changes to Tree, Crop and Grass behaviour.
Note: Enabling "Cast Anywhere" in configuration will enable rite casting in any location. Have tested, and can confirm, will spawn trees on the beach.

-----------------------------------------
TOOl - RITE Behaviour
-----------------------------------------
Any of these four tools (Pickaxe, Axe, Hoe, WateringCan) or any Melee Weapon (Including Scythe) must be selected in toolbar to perform a rite (cast)
Some of the main questlines offer melee weapons that are each aligned with a druidic theme
Forest Sword will always activate Rite of the Earth regardless of what blessing has been chosen with the Effigy. This will be true for other weapons reference or gained in quests for new rites.

CONFIG FILE
-----------------------------------------
GMCM has been integrated

Rite Buttons "riteButtons" is a list of keybinds set to MouseX1, MouseX2, Keyboard.V and LeftShoulder
- Holding the specified control will increase the range of the mechanic, up to ~7.5 tiles radius.
- Keybinds can be changed in mod configuration after installing

-----------------------------------------
Action Buttons "actionButtons" is a list of keybinds set to MouseLeft, ControllerX and Keyboard.C
This OPTIONAL configuration does not override or edit in-game keybinds for the action controls, instead it just enables the mod to detect when the action/use tool button has been pressed. This is useful in the case that the action button is mapped to a non-conventional input, such as a special button on non-standard controllers or gaming mice.

-----------------------------------------
Special Buttons "specialButtons" is a list of keybinds set to MouseRight, ControllerY and Keyboard.X
This works exactly as above but for the special function. 

-----------------------------------------
Journal Button is a list of keybinds set to K
This OPTIONAL configuration will open the Stardew Druid journal from the game world.

-----------------------------------------
Disable Cast Hands
Stardew Druid employs a 'pause and play single frame animation' for the farmer sprite when the rite button is used to trigger Druid events. This can be disabled to improve compatibility with mods that manage or modify the farmer sprite.

-----------------------------------------
Slot Attunement "slotAttune"
Rite casts will be based on selected slot in the toolbar as opposed to weapon or tool attunement. Slot 1 Weald, Slot 2 Mists, Slot 3 Stars, Slot 4 Fates, Slot 5 Ether. Overrides patron selection and weapon attunement.
These options can be further configured in the customData.json file that comes with the mod

The mod will load the next lesson/quest at the start of each in game day, without the need to approach any of the quest NPCs.

----------------------------------------- 
Set Progress "setProgress" (newProgress in 1.6)
Can be used to override the mod state on game load. -1 is the default for no effective change.
