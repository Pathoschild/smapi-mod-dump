# Sorting Chests

## A Stardew Valley mod which helps you put the same item in different chests together to save space.

- Once your save is loaded, it will sort all the chests in all the locations.
- When something is put into or grabbed from a chest, it will be sorted.

During sorting, the same objects in different chests will be stacked together automatically.

Items with max stack size will not be taken into account - because we cannot stack into it anymore! But once it's not with max stack size, it will be sorted.

Supports [ChestsAnyWhere](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/518), [Automate](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1063) and almost all the mods! (Because it's not a very complex mod...)

Shipping Bin isn't taken into consideration. You can safely put items into the shipping bin.

It only sort chests in the same location!

This mod is open sourced and is published both on [Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/8224) and [Github](https://github.com/aRooooooba/SortingChests). It would be great if any issue could be posted on Github so that I can be notified at once.
