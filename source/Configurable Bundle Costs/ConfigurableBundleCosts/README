Configurable Bundle Costs
Allows the player to configure the cost of Joja/Vault bundles.

Note: This mod has not been thoroughly tested for multiplayer use. Please report any issues you come across on the Nexus mod page.

If you have any issues:
Make sure SMAPI is up-to-date. (NOTE: I am not currently supporting the beta 64-bit branch of SMAPI/the upcoming SDV 1.5.5)
Make sure GMCM is up-to-date if you are using it.
Make sure you do not have any other mods installed which modify the Joja Community Development Form menu.
You can reach me on the Stardew Valley discord (Vertigon#1851) or on the Nexus mod page.
Please provide a SMAPI log so that I can assist you better.
