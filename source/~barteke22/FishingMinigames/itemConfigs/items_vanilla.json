    //The above item is an example of how you can add effects to ingame or modded fishing rods, baits and tackles. "Example Item Name" is ignored by code.
    //Any effects added directly to the GetFish() method are automatically included. Some effects, like DIFFICULTY and SIZE, influence others.

    //IMPORTANT: Due to how json is generated (not user friendly), I chose to provide this file with every update instead of generating a new one if missing - so you might accidentally overwrite it.
    //If you plan on editing these values, I recommend renaming this file to items_vanilla2.json - that way it'll overwrite same items in any future update items_vanilla.json.
