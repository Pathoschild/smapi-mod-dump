# TV Brasileira

## Overview

This mod replaces the in-game TV channels in Stardew Valley with Brazilian-themed content. This includes new dialogue and animated sprites for each channel.
[See more.](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/10843)

## Features

- 50+ new dialogue lines for the in-game TV programs
- New sprites for each channel
- Ability to enable or disable individual channels through the Generic Mod Config Menu (GMCM) or the config.json file
- Available in both Portuguese and English (note that the English version does not take context into account)

## Installation

1. Install the latest version of [SMAPI](https://smapi.io/)
3. [Download the mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/10843) and extract it to the `Stardew Valley/Mods` folder
4. Run the game using SMAPI

## Usage

Extracting the mod into the right folder is enough! However, it's possible to configure the mod and enable/disable programs individually through the Generic Mod Config Menu (recommended):

- Go to Options > Scroll to the bottom > Select Mod Options > Select TV Brasileira

You can also configure through the gear button in the Main Menu or configure the `config.json` file manually if you don't have GMCM.

## Compatibility

- Compatible with Stardew Valley 1.5 on Linux, Mac, and Windows
- In multiplayer, a player must have the mod installed to access the features (optional)

## Todo
- [ ] Add custom soundtrack for each channel
- [ ] Master banning you to the shadow realm if you make him mad
- [ ] New characters (ongoing Fortune Teller)
- [ ] New sprite for the island weather report, along with moving the small weather sprites to another position on-screen (half done)
