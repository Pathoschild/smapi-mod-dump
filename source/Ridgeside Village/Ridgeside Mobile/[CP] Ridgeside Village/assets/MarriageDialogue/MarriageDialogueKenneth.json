///Spring
	"spring_1": "Ah, spring! Everything starts to thaw, regrow, and start life all over again. #$b#I guess the people of the valley can be like that at times, too, huh?",
	"spring_12": "Would you like to go to the festival with me tomorrow, @?#$b#I'll need to keep an eye on the electronics, but I'll certainly make some time for you.$h",
	"spring_23": "You know, I've never been too big on dancing.#$b#But the happiness that everyone gets from the dance is almost contagious!$h",

///Summer
	"summer_1": "Oh yeah, it's summer time! Beaches, sunshine, relaxing... ha ha!$h#$b#I can't wait to spend the hottest seasons of the year with you, @.$l",
	"summer_10": "I've been working with Maru to create a machine to help move the laua pot for tomorrow.#$b#Poor Ian always gets so worn out carrying the thing he passes out in the sand after we eat, ha ha!$h",

///Fall
	"fall_1": "I always get so jumpy in the fall... Why? Oh, um... well, don't make fun of me, but it's like all the little woodland creatures decide it's prankster season.#$b#I'm used to working on machines, okay!$s#$b#When little bunnies and squirrels jump out of a bush or a tree I don't expect that.$s#$b#W-What?! Quit laughing, @!$l",

	"fall_26": "Shh, don't tell anyone, but Maru and I messed with the lights in the town square.#$b#At midnight they'll turn a deep red to be all spooky. Ha ha!$h#$b#That should give the kiddos a bit of a fright.$h",

///Winter
	"winter_1": "Normally I get really worried about the conditions of the lights and everything in the winter.#$b#I'll try and relax a bit more with you though, enjoy the time we have together.$l",
	"winter_2": "Oh, the lights in town are looking a little rough...#$b#Sorry, @, but I'm gonna be busy with them.#$b#What? Oh, I know I said I'd relax some, but... well, you know. Don't worry, I'll still make some time to kick my feet up with you!$h#$b#Now, anyway...",
	"winter_7": "The festival tomorrow reminds me of when I was a kid going to the festival. One year I made an automatic fishing rod modification, so that whenever it got a tug on the line it'd automatically real in the fish for me.#$b#Well, I miscalculated the power of it, and the first fish I got went flying...$u#$b#I swear it went halfway to the ridge! Ha ha. Needless to say I haven't competed since then.$h",

	"winter_15": "I don't know about the stability of the docks with all those boats attached and everyone walking around... makes me a bit nervous.#$b#You be careful, okay, @?",
	"winter_16": "I snuck down to the pier earlier and checked it out. I added a couple braces to the pier supports. Willy saw me and asked what I was doing; I told him I was just trying to make sure everyone was safe.#$b#He laughed and just walked back to his house talking to himself. Well, hey, at least everyone will be safe!",
	"winter_17": "Keahi gave me a little stuffed dog. He said he got it from one of the boat vendors and thought I'd like it.#$b#I don't know where he heard about my dog from, but... it really means a lot to me.$h#$b#I'm a real happy guy, @.",
	"winter_24": "Maru and I have been working overtime to make sure the festival goes off without a hitch tomorrow.#$b#We used a new generator to get some extra juice for the tree and all the lights. On the one hand, it could all go off smoothly! But on the other... well, just stay away from the tree just in case, okay?#$b#I'm sure it'll be fine, but... ha ha, well, you know.$h",

///Room
"spouseRoom_Kenneth": "I've been working on a new project. It's another little robot!#$b# It won't be over-the-top this time, though. Just a little hobby to pass the time.$h#$b# Hm... I wonder if I can make it like a small robot butler...",
