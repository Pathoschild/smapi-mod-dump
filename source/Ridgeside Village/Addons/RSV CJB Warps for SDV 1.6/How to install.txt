HOW TO INSTALL!

Overwrite the warps.json file located at Mods > CJBCheatsMenu > assets > warps.json

NOTICE:
This only includes Vanilla & RSV locations. You can MANUALLY add other locations from other mods on your own. 

Learn how to here:
https://github.com/CJBok/SDV-Mods/tree/master/CJBCheatsMenu#readme%20for%20more%20info.

PLEASE DO NOT ask me to make a warp.json for every mod out there.
You can do it, right? Of course you can :3
