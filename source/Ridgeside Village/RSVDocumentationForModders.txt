RSV Documentation for tile data other mods can use

Action | ShowImage "gamepath" [scale (float)] [string ID]
Action | RSV.TrashCan [ID (can be a string ID, just no spaces)] (default is -1 if omitted) config at [CP] Ridgeside Village\Data\Extras\TrashCanData.json

You can edit the RSVworld maps by patching;
"Assets/LooseSprites/RSVMap.png" for the village map and/or
"Assets/LooseSprites/RSVWorldMap.png" for the RSV world map.

Mod authors can add their own NPC's wedding reception image with the simple CP patch

//Change spouse picture during wedding reception
      //For use for other NPC modders who want to add a wedding reception picture of their NPC
    {
        "Action": "EditImage",
        "Target": "Maps/z_RSVspousePic",
        "FromFile": "assets/Abigail.png", //Your spouse's picture! It should be 144x112 pixels w/ transparent background(If you want to use the default background)
        "When": {
            "Query: '{{Spouse}}' = 'Abigail'": true //Change spouse name to the name of your NPC
        },
        "Update": "OnLocationChange, OnTimeChange",
    },
	
They can edit existing images as well using the same patch.
