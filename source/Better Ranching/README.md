# Stardew Valley Mod - Better Ranching
Stardew Valley mod that prevents doomed milking/shearing attempts and adds an indicator when animals can be petted, milked, or sheared: https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/859/

Compatible with Stardew Valley 1.4.3+ on Linux, Mac, and Windows. Requires SMAPI 3.0 or later.

**New Update:** I added the fix that the awesome minervamaga made to stop errors introduced in the last game update! I also fixed the bug that was causing dogs/cats to keep their heart icons even if the config setting was turned off.
