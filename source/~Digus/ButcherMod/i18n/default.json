	"AnimalContest.Dialog.ShaneAct.Lewis.FirstTime4": "You did great for a first timer, but you're still missing a thing or two.",
	"AnimalContest.Dialog.ShaneAct.Shane.FirstTime3": "This hen was one of the first to have the blue color. So I know it's not as young as required.#$b#It also had to have a specific diet. So I couldn't give it as many treats as I wanted.",
	"AnimalContest.Dialog.ShaneAct.Lewis.FirstTime5": "Oh, I see Marnie has thought you well. I'm sure you'll do better next time then.",

	"AnimalContest.Dialog.EmilyAct.Lewis.FirstTime3": "Well, I never saw a case like this. But there's no rule against it.#$b#Does it know any tricks?",
	"AnimalContest.Dialog.EmilyAct.Emily.FirstTime3": "Why don't you ask him yourself?",
	"AnimalContest.Dialog.EmilyAct.Lewis.FirstTime4": "Er... do you know any tricks?",
	"AnimalContest.Dialog.EmilyAct.Lewis.FirstTime5": "Nice, you answered me, any more tricks?$h",
	"AnimalContest.Dialog.EmilyAct.Emily.FirstTime4": "It's my fault, I should have talked to him how the contest work, so he could prepare better.$s",
