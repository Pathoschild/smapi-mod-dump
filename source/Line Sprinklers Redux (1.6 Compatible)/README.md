# LineSprinklersRedux

A spiritual successor to the original Adds Straight Line Sprinklers which water in a single direction. The number of tiles watered is the same as vanilla sprinklers, just drawn out in a straight line:

- Basic Sprinklers: 4 Tiles
- Quality Sprinklers: 8 Tiles
- Iridium Sprinklers: 24 Tiles

## Features

- **Compatible with most Sprinkler mods** - The game is patched to consider these sprinklers, so most sprinkler mods should be compatible with Line Sprinklers Redux out of the box. If you find an incompatible mod, raise it in the comments and I'll take a look.
- **Rotatable** - Sprinklers can be rotated while held, or after being placed. The hotkey for this can be configured with Generic Mod Configuration Menu, but the default hotkey is Middle Click
- **Craftable** - They unlock at the same time as the vanilla sprinklers. Each line sprinkler is configured from it's vanilla counterpart.
- **Recyclable** - If you throw a line sprinkler in a Recycler, it will be recycled into a vanilla sprinkler of the same type.
