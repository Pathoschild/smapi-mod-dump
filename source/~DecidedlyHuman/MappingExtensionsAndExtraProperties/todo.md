# Currently tackling

# Done, to be tested

# Requires drastic changes
* Inventory items which open a closeup interaction menu

# Oh, no
* Special, fancy, animated backgrounds
* Animated images.

# Difficulty not examined yet
* Atravita: maybe out of scope, but what if I could open a MEEP picture at the end of a dialogue pretty please?
* Atravita: If you want to reallllllyyyyyy scope creep give me TAS? (temporary animated sprite)
* Screen reader/general accessibility via Stardew Access (https://github.com/khanshoaib3/stardew-access)
* Counter for how many times a fake NPC has been chatted with, via a CP token, maybe?
* MEEP event commands!
* Custom letter stationery
* Locating warping tile property, similar to BusLocation, but anywhere!

# Pretty easy

# Easy, but lots of refactoring
* Make a more generic argument parsing system to get rid of needing excessive amounts of TryParse methods.

# Easy, but needs some systems in place
* MEEP buff tile properties! Once per day will be more difficult, but otherwise very easy.

# Slightly tricky
* Support high-res image, and/or image auto-scaling if larger than the screen.
