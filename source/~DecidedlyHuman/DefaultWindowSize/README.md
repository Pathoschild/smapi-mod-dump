# Default Window Size

All releases can be found on my [Nexus page](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/79440738?tab=user+files), and
my [ModDrop](https://www.moddrop.com/stardew-valley/profile/251772/mods) page.

Ever wanted Stardew Valley to start up with a specific window size? Well, now you can.

Also comes with a command to allow you to set a resolution manually from the SMAPI console:

Set the resolution of the Stardew Valley window. (Minimum 1280x720)
Usage: `set_resolution <Resolution>`
