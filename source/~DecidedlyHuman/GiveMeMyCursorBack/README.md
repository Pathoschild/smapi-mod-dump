# Give Me My Cursor Back!
All releases can be found on my [Nexus page](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/79440738?tab=user+files), and my [ModDrop](https://www.moddrop.com/stardew-valley/profile/251772/mods) page.

This mod will make it so that, when you're alt tabbed (and don't have the hardware cursor setting toggled on), you can see your cursor when it's over the Stardew Valley window.
