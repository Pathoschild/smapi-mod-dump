# DecidedlyHuman's Stardew Valley Mods

Welcome to the monolothic repo where all of my Stardew Valley mods will live.

My pledge is as follows: every single released mod I make will be open source, using a fair, permissive license. Art assets that I create myself (or ones I commission and attain the full rights to) will be licensed under Creative Commons. Before they're released, they're very much considered closed source, unless their `LICENSE.txt` says otherwise.

Each individual mod will have its own `README.md`, and `LICENSE.txt`.

The only official places to find my mods are here, Nexus Mods, and ModDrop. While my licenses explicitly allow anybody to re-upload my mods, anything not under one of my accounts should be considered third-party.

## Released mods
* [Smart Building](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/11158) -- This mod will make placing fences, floors, furnaces, etc. a much more streamlined experience.
* [Carry Your Pet](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/13009) -- Allows you to pick up your pet, and move them somewhere else on the farm.
* [Better Return Scepter](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/11610) -- Ever wished the return sceptre would let you warp back to where you were when you used it last? Well, now it does.
* [Player Co-ordinates HUD and Logger](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/7969) -- A small mod that logs your character/cursor co-ordinates to assist with modding.
* [Give Me My Cursor Back!](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/9976) -- A tiny mod that ensures your cursor is visible when over the Stardew Valley window when it isn't in focus.

* [Better Crystalariums](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/10907) -- A mod that will prevent you from accidentally inserting a new mineral into your crystalariums.
* [Default Window Size](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/10939) -- This mod will allow you to specify a resolution that Stardew Valley will start up in, precisely, every single time.
* [Into the Game](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/12826) -- Ever missed that Stardew Valley has finished loading into your world because it takes too long? Well, this mod will whistle at you when it's done loading!
* [Smart Cursor](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/13268) -- Have you played Terraria? Do you wish Stardew had something similar to its smart cursor feature for harvesting resources? Well, now it does!

## But DH, I see other mods in this repo! Why aren't they listed here?!
Well... I'm slow, okay? Don't judge me. Any mod in this repo not listed on this page will be in varying states of chaos, completeness, and licensing.

## Contributing
Feel free to contribute ideas, code, translations, anything your heart desires. I intend to keep everything fairly lax, so don't worry about being too formal, or too informal.
