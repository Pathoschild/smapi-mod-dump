# DecidedlyHuman's Stardew Valley Mods

Welcome to the monolothic repo where all of my Stardew Valley mods will live. 

My pledge is as follows: every single mod I make will be open source, using a fair, permissive license. Art assets that I create myself (or ones I commission and attain the full rights to) will be licensed under Creative Commons.

Each individual mod will have its own `README.md`, and `LICENSE.txt`.

The only official places to find my mods are here, Nexus Mods, and ModDrop. While my licenses explicitly allow anybody to re-upload my mods, anything not under one of my accounts should be considered third-party.

## Current Mods

[Player Co-ordinates HUD and Logger](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/7969) � A small mod that logs your character/cursor co-ordinates to assist with modding.  
[Give Me My Cursor Back!](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/9976) � A tiny mod that ensures your cursor is visible when over the Stardew Valley window when it isn't in focus.

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute ideas, code, translations, anything your heart desires. I intend to keep everything fairly lax, so don't worry about being too formal, or too informal.
