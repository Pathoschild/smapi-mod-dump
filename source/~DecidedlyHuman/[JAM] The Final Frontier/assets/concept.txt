Premise
Boat from Willy's to a mysterious explosive launchpad in the middle of the ocean. 
Here, you'll meet Marlon, who'll give you the intel that Joja has a space station
in orbit, and nobody knows what they plan to do. 

He tells you that it's up to you to head up there, and discover what plans they have.

On the space station, you'll have to look around for signs of their plans. Once you've
found all of their plans, Marlon will appear near the entrance of the station, and tell
you that you have to destroy it.

Requirements:
Map patch outside Willy's shop for the new boat
Joja launch pad map
Fake Marlon NPC on a dock outside the Joja launch pad
Decorations tilesheet for a Joja space station
Tilesheet containing Joja tiles
Lots of MEEP_CloseupInteraction images for interacting with evidence
Lots of MEEP_SetMailFlag properties for the destruction route
Conditional patches for siding with Joja
