# Smart Cursor Changelog

## 1.1.4
#### Fixes
* Fixed the mod not actually loading its configuration values internally at launch. They were previously applied to GMCM, but not the mod's data itself.

## 1.1.3
#### Fixes
* Fixed bug with GMCM integration not correctly saving configuration changes.

## 1.1.2
#### Fixes
* Fixed the GMCM config menu not actually saving the range settings. Oops.
#### Tweaks
* Now you can just hold down the tool hit key to continue hitting at things within range, instead of needing to click for each individual one.

## 1.1.0

* Added the ability to customise the hit range for different tool tiers.

## 1.0.0

* The mod exists.
