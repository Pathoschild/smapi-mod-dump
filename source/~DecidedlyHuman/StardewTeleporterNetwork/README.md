# Smart Building mod for Stardew Valley
All releases can be found on my [Nexus page](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/79440738?tab=user+files), and my [ModDrop](https://www.moddrop.com/stardew-valley/profile/251772/mods) page.

This mod makes placing placeable items on your farm more convenient. 

You can enter building mode to draw with your placeables on the ground, erasing mistakes as needed, and finally committing your drawing. At that point, everything will be instantaneously placed on the ground!

(This will also let you place floors and grass starters underneath existing fences!)

Currently works with all of the major placeable objects in the base game. Things from mods *should* work, but I can't test every single one! Let me know if you encounter any that don't work, or work weirdly.

## Default Settings

* Enter build mode: Left shift + B
* Draw: Right mouse
* Erase: Left shift
* Confirm build: Left mouse
* Allow crab pots in any water tile: false
