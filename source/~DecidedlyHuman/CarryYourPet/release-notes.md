# Carry Your Pet release notes

## 1.2.0
Now instead of needing to click on your pet with the carry key held down to drop them, you simply have to press the key. No clicking involved, so dropping tiny animals should be completely fooltproof.
## 1.1.0
Now you can carry farm animals, and the player actually holds the animal/pet above their head!
## 1.0.0
The mod exists!
