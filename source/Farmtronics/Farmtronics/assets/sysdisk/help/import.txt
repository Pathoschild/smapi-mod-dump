The `import` command loads a MiniScript
file from the current directory, 
`/usr/lib`, `/sys/lib`, or some path 
defined in `env.importPaths`.  Any values
defined by that code then become
available in a map of the same name.  
Example:

`import "mathUtil"`
`print mathUtil.radToDeg(2*pi)`  

Some modules, like `listUtil`, 
`stringUtil`, and `mapUtil`, extend these
built-in types with new methods.  For 
example, the built-in `list` type does not
have a `.reverse` method, but it does 
once you import "listUtil":

`import "listUtil"`
`print [1,2,3].reverse`  // [3, 2, 1]

Be sure to `view` (or `load` and `edit`) the
modules in `/sys/lib` to see what they
do, and how they work!
