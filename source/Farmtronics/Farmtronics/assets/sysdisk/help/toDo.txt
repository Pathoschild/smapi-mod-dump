To help you learn your way around the
Farmtronics system, a `toDo` command has
been included for your use.

Just type `toDo` (or `todo`) at the prompt
and press Return.  Then use the up/down
arrow keys to examine the details of any
task.  Tasks will be automatically 
checked off when you complete them.

4 out of 5 users surveyed found
completing the `toDo` tasks to be very 
rewarding!
