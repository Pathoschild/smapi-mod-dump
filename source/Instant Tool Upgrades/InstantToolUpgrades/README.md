# Instant Tool Upgrades
Click [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/8918) to see this mod's page on Nexusmods.com.

# How It Works
The mod continuously checks to see if any tools have been queued up for upgrades. As soon as an upgrade is queued up, the mod immediately gives the player the upgraded tool (or levels up the Trash Can) and cancels the queued upgrade.
