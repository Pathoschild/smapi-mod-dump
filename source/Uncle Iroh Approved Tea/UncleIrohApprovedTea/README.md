Where to find specific parts of the mod!

How to use each crop with this mod:
- Chamomile -> Chamomile Tea 
- Chrysanthemum -> Chrysanthemum Tea -> tea is also used for kitchen recipe for health blend tea
- Goji Berry -> Dried Goji Berries (3x Goji Berry into dehydrator) -> dried is also used for kitchen recipe for health blend tea
- Lavender -> Lavender Tea

## Other Items

- Orange -> eat for Orange Peel -> dehydrator for dried orange peel used for kitchen recipe
- Strawberry -> Dried Strawberries (into dehydrator) -> used as a gift or snack (this one can be turned of in config menu if you prefer vanilla dehydrated fruit)  

## Seeds

Most of the seeds and bush saplings are at Pierre's Seed Shop, but you will find the Cassia Flower tree at Sandy's Shop.  

## Tea

Most tea is brewed using the Teapot (by default,) except health blend tea requires a kitchen to make. You can find the recipe for Health Blend Tea at the Hospital (Harvey's shop.)  

If you would rather be able to use a kitchen for all tea (recipes available at Gus' and Sandy's), then you can choose the Tea Recipes option in the Mod Config Menu under (CP) Uncle Iroh Approved Tea. You can uncheck Brewable Tea to make the teapot purely decorative as well.  

## Teapot

The Teapot recipe is unlocked at farming level 2! It takes Stone and Clay to craft one.
