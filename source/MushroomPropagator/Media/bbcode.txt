After Robin builds your cellar, Demetrius will drop in to give you the recipe to his new project – a rotten old log that grows mushrooms overnight!

[img]https://i.imgur.com/x8XztE0.png[/img]The Propagator isn't immediately available – you'll be given the recipe when you have [b][color=#efefef]a farmhouse cellar and a mushroom cave![/color][/b]
[img]https://i.imgur.com/x8XztE0.png[/img]Demetrius will visit the morning after Robin finishes your cellar to deliver the recipe.
[img]https://i.imgur.com/x8XztE0.png[/img]Unless changed in the config, the propagation log isn't available with a fruit cave!

[img]https://i.imgur.com/XHPtoOQ.png[/img][size=3][b]Crafting[/b][/size]
[img]https://i.imgur.com/x8XztE0.png[/img]Logs are crafted with the same ingredients as a cask – [color=#efefef][b]20 wood and 1 hardwood![/b][/color]
[img]https://i.imgur.com/x8XztE0.png[/img]Place a mushroom on the log to start growing!

[size=3][b][img]https://i.imgur.com/wdt2cIh.png[/img]Growing[/b][/size]
[img]https://i.imgur.com/x8XztE0.png[/img]At the end of the day, each of the logs will grow a little more.
[img]https://i.imgur.com/x8XztE0.png[/img]A common mushroom will typically grow every night, a red mushroom every two nights, and a purple mushroom every four nights.
   ﻿Custom mushrooms added with Json Assets, like Shiitake Mushrooms and Black Fungus, will grow relative to their value.
   You can leave the logs for a few days and they'll keep growing more mushrooms for their stacks for when you check on them.
[img]https://i.imgur.com/x8XztE0.png[/img]The logs can only hold so many of each type of mushroom, though: bigger and better mushrooms will grow smaller stacks.
[img]https://i.imgur.com/x8XztE0.png[/img]Keep an eye out for logs with huge, fully-grown mushrooms: they've reached their capacity, and you'll need to pop them off to keep growing.

[size=3][b][img]https://i.imgur.com/wdt2cIh.png[/img]Interacting[/b][/size]
[img]https://i.imgur.com/x8XztE0.png[/img]Click a log while holding a mushroom to add it as the root-mushroom. If the log's not empty, it'll swap to the new mushroom.
[img]https://i.imgur.com/x8XztE0.png[/img]Click the log later on to pop any extra mushrooms off it, and click it again to pop the root-mushroom off.
[img]https://i.imgur.com/x8XztE0.png[/img]Like the Casks in your cellar, you can whack them with an axe or a hoe to pop off the root-mushroom, too.

[size=3][b][img]https://i.imgur.com/wdt2cIh.png[/img]Professions[/b][/size]
[img]https://i.imgur.com/x8XztE0.png[/img]Your [b]Foraging[/b] professions improve the mushrooms you grow!
[img]https://i.imgur.com/x8XztE0.png[/img]With the [color=#efefef][b]Gatherer[/b][/color] profession, you'll get a chance for a bonus mushroom on each harvest.
[img]https://i.imgur.com/x8XztE0.png[/img]With the [b]Botanist[/b] profession, you'll pluck only the highest-quality mushrooms.

[img]https://i.imgur.com/F7CdLyz.png[/img][size=3]If you'd like to use the logs in places other than your cellar and the cave, you can enable them almost anywhere else, too.[/size]

[img]https://i.imgur.com/F7CdLyz.png[/img][size=3][color=#f9cb9c][b][font=Courier New]DisabledForFruitCave[/font][/b][/color] – Picked the fruit cave and you still want to grow more mushrooms? I'll allow it![/size]

[img]https://i.imgur.com/F7CdLyz.png[/img][size=3][color=#f9cb9c][b][font=Courier New]RecipeAlwaysAvailable[/font][/b][/color] – No time for Demetrius? Don't want a big house? You can get the recipe from day 1![/size]
﻿
[img]https://i.imgur.com/F7CdLyz.png[/img][size=3][color=#f9cb9c][b][font=Courier New]MaximumDaysToMature[/font][/b][/color] – Want mushrooms to grow faster or slower to match your other mods? Change the timescale![/size]

[img]https://i.imgur.com/F7CdLyz.png[/img][size=3][color=#f9cb9c][b][font=Courier New]MaximumQuantityLimitsDoubled[/font][/b][/color] – Don't check the cellar often? The total mushrooms each log holds can be raised![/size]

[img]https://i.imgur.com/F7CdLyz.png[/img][size=3][color=#f9cb9c][b][font=Courier New]OnlyToolsCanRemoveRootMushrooms[/font][/b][/color] – Want better control over your logs? Clicking won't pop mushrooms off using this![/size]

[img]https://i.imgur.com/F7CdLyz.png[/img][size=3][color=#f9cb9c][b][font=Courier New]PulseWhenGrowing[/font][/b][/color] – Don't want a visible growing effect? You don't need it, set this to false![/size]

[img]https://i.imgur.com/F7CdLyz.png[/img][size=3][color=#f9cb9c][b][font=Courier New]OtherObjectsThatCanBeGrown[/font][/b][/color] – The mushroom machine accepts all custom items named as a "mushroom" or "fungus".[/size]
[img]https://i.imgur.com/x8XztE0.png[/img]If you have any custom objects that use a different name, like "Red Cap" instead of "Red Cap Mushroom", add them here!
