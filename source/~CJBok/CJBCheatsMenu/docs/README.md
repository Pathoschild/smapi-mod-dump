Compatible with Stardew Valley 1.5.5+ on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

## Install
1. [Install the latest version of SMAPI](https://smapi.io/).
2. [Install this mod from Nexus mods](http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/4).
3. Run the game using SMAPI.

## Use
* Press `P` (configurable) to show the cheats menu.
* You can also enable active cheats by editing the `config.json` file.

## Configure
The mod will work fine out of the box, but you can tweak its settings by editing the `config.json`
file. Most of the settings should be edited in-game through the cheats menu instead, so only those
you may need to edit directly are listed here.

### Key bindings
See [valid key bindings](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Player_Guide/Key_Bindings). Simple
key bindings can be configured through the in-game UI, but multi-key bindings can only be set in the
`config.json` file.

setting | default | what it affects
------- | ------- | ---------------
`OpenMenuKey` | `P` | The keybind which opens the menu.
`FreezeTimeKey` | `T` | The keybind which freezes the game clock.
`GrowTreeKey` | `NumPad1` | The keybind held to grow trees around the player.
`GrowCropsKey` | `NumPad2` | The keybind held to grow crops around the player.
`GrowRadius` | `1` | The number of tiles in each direction around the player to cover when pressing the `GrowCropsKey` or `GrowTreeKey`.

### Menu settings
setting | default | what it affects

## Editing warps

match your map edits and custom locations.
