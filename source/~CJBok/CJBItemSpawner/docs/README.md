Compatible with Stardew Valley 1.5.5+ on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

## Install
1. [Install the latest version of SMAPI](https://smapi.io/).
2. [Install this mod from Nexus mods](http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/93).
3. Run the game using SMAPI.

## Use
Press `i` on your keyboard (configurable) to open the menu.

In the menu you can...
* Change item quality by clicking the quality button.
* Change category filters by clicking the dropdown, with `left`/`right` on a keyboard, or with `left trigger`/`right trigger` on a controller.
* Scroll items by clicking the arrows, with your mouse scroll wheel, with `up`/`down` on your keyboard, or with the right thumbstick on a controller.
* Search by pointing at the search box and typing an item name.

## Configure
The mod will work fine out of the box, but you can tweak its settings by editing the `config.json`
file. These are the available settings.

```
