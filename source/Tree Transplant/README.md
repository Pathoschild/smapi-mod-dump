Once you're in the tree transplant menu it's simple to start moving your trees.

First, left-click on the tree you wish to move to highlight it.  By left-clicking again you can move the tree to a new location.

A tree can only be relocated when all of the surrounding tiles are green, 
if they are red that means there is a collision with another object such as a rock or building.

Certain trees also have different requirements for growth like this sapling which needs all surrounding tiles to be clear in order to grow.

By right-clicking with a tree selected or using the flip button in the bottom right corner you can flip the tree around for trees that support it.
