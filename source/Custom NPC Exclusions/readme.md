Multiplayer note:
* It is recommended that **all players** install this mod for multiplayer sessions. There are no known issues directly related to this mod, but NPC mods can cause unexpected errors if mismatched.

## Exclusion Rules
This mod can apply different exclusion rules to each individual NPC, preventing them being involved in the related quests and events.

The available exclusion rules are:

Rule | Category | Description

All | | Excludes the NPC from all content affected by this mod.
TownEvent | | Excludes the NPC from all content in the "TownEvent" category (see below).

IslandEvent | | Excludes the NPC from all content in the "IslandEvent" category (see below).
OtherEvent | | Excludes the NPC from all content in the "OtherEvent" category (see below).
MovieInvite | TownEvent | Excludes the NPC from receiving a Movie Ticket. This will use custom text from "Strings/Characters:MovieInvite_CantInvite_**NPCName**" if available.

WinterStar | TownEvent | Excludes the NPC from giving or receiving secret gifts at the Feast of the Winter Star festival.

ItemDelivery | TownQuest | Excludes the NPC from randomized "item delivery" quests on the Help Wanted board.
Socialize | TownQuest | Excludes the NPC from "socialize" quests, which currently includes the "Introductions" quest at the start of the game.

BeGreeted | OtherEvent | Excludes the NPC from being greeted by other NPCs while traveling.
Greet | OtherEvent | Excludes the NPC from greeting other NPCs while traveling.
PerfectFriend | OtherEvent | Excludes the NPC from Stardew's "perfection score" tracker when it checks for maximum friendship with NPCs.

## Mod Examples
This mod loads a new data asset into Stardew: `Data/CustomNPCExclusions`.

The asset is similar to other "Data" types and is a `Dictionary<string, string>` internally. Each entry should have a NPC's name as the *key*, and a set of exclusion rules for that NPC as the *value*. Exclusion rules can be separated by spaces, commas, or forward slashes.

The asset can be edited in multiple ways; see the sections below for example of specific methods.

### SMAPI Mods
SMAPI mods can edit NPC exclusions by adding events with the `helper`. See this wiki page for an overview: [https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Modder_Guide/APIs/Content#Edit_a_game_asset](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Modder_Guide/APIs/Content#Edit_a_game_asset)

Below is a more specific example, which adds the "WinterStar" and "ItemDelivery" rules to a custom NPC named "MyCustomNpcName":

```cs
public override void Entry(IModHelper helper)
{
	helper.Events.Content.AssetRequested += this.OnAssetRequested;
}

private void OnAssetRequested(object sender, AssetRequestedEventArgs e)
{
	if (e.NameWithoutLocale.IsEquivalentTo("Data/CustomNPCExclusions"))
	{
		e.Edit(asset =>
		{
			var data = asset.AsDictionary<string, string>().Data;
			data.Add("MyCustomNpcName", "WinterStar ItemDelivery"); 
		});
	}
}
```

### Content Patcher Mods
Content Patcher's content packs can edit NPC exclusions by using `"Action": "EditData"` with `"Target": "Data/CustomNPCExclusions"`. See the Content Patcher author guide for an overview: [https://github.com/Pathoschild/StardewMods/blob/develop/ContentPatcher/docs/author-guide.md#editdata](https://github.com/Pathoschild/StardewMods/blob/develop/ContentPatcher/docs/author-guide.md#editdata)

Below is a more specific example, which adds the "WinterStar" and "ItemDelivery" rules to a custom NPC named "MyCustomNpcName":

```js
{
   "Format": "1.29.0",
   "Changes": [
      {
         "Action": "EditData",
         "Target": "Data/CustomNPCExclusions",
         "Entries": {
            "MyCustomNpcName": "WinterStar ItemDelivery"
         }
      }
   ]
}
```
