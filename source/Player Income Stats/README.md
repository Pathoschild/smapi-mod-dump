# PlayerIncomeStats
This mod simply adds a panel containing info about each farmer's contribution to the shared/their own wallet, for those who like competition and/or numbers. Income calculation only works for those goods sold out in the vanilla shipping bin.

The panel can be freely moved around with mouse and hidden if desired with 'Shift+V' key combination.

Note: due to how item shipping system works in the game, I had to use Harmony patches, but it's postfixes only; both sides need to have this mod installed in order for it to work as intended.

The first number in a row implies a farmer's overall income, the second is temporary (resets every new day) and implies a current day contribution. And finally the number in the last row is a sum of all current day incomes.
