# ![[icon]](promo/icon.png) Cropbeasts

*a [Stardew Valley](http://stardewvalley.net/) mod by [kdau](https://www.kdau.com)*

Why just harvest your crops when you could do battle with them? Cropbeasts are crops cursed by the witch that turn into monsters on your farm. After you defeat them, you get the original harvest and maybe something extra.

## ![Compatibility](https://www.kdau.com/headers/compatibility.png)

**Game:** Stardew Valley 1.5+

**Platform:** Linux, macOS or Windows (Android not yet supported)

**Multiplayer:** works; every player must install\
*(Only the farmer/host will control the spawning of cropbeasts.)*

**Other mods:**

* Save Anywhere: don't save while cropbeasts are active
* custom crops: can be set up to become cropbeasts; see "Customization" below
