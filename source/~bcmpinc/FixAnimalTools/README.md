# Fix Animal Tool Animations

## Description
When using the shears or milk pail, you're locked in place until the animation finishes. With this mod the animation no longer plays when no animal is nearby.

## Dependencies
This mod requires the following mods to be installed:

* [SMAPI](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2400)
* [StardewHack](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/3213)

## Known bugs
Please report bugs on [GitHub](https://github.com/bcmpinc/StardewHack/issues).

## Changes
#### 7.0:
* Localization support. (Not that this mod has any text though)

#### 6.0:
* Increased version number so it has the same major version as StardewHack.

#### 4.0:
* Add 64-bit support
