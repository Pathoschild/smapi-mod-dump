     * If you're looking for the old API methods, those were implemented as follows.
     * You can copy the code and use that instead of the old API.
     * These work regardless of whether Wear More Rings is installed. 
     * If Wear More rings is installed, GetAllRings will include the ring slots that are added by that mod.
     * For combined rings, GetAllRings will return the rings used to create that combined ring, rather than the combined ring itself.
     * If you need access to the combined rings, or want to manipulate the modded ring slots directly, that's only possible with the new API.
     * 
     * CountEquippedRings's which argument probably needs to be changed into a string for SDV 1.6.
