Object Progress Bars - 1.0.0
Shows progress bars on refining or artisan goods machines. Use keyboard key 'P' to toggle progress bars (configurable).

REQUIREMENTS:
• Stardew Valley 1.3
• SMAPI 2.7 or later

INSTALLATION:
• Unzip the mod folder into Stardew Valley/Mods

FEATURES:
• Shows accurate progress bars that can be toggled on/off with a shortcut key.
• Calculates  progress based on the time left until processing will be complete and total time a machine takes for completion, according to the wiki.
• Guesses progress for the few machines (Worm Bin, Oil Maker, Cask(?)) that don't have a determinable total time.
• Progress bars resemble original game UI.

CAVEATS:
• Worm Bin and Oil Maker progress might look inconsistent every time game is loaded since the total time is being guessed. However they do sort of provide a correct estimation of time left on processing.
• Cask wasn't tested since I don't have a cellar. It's behavior might be weird.
• Mod was only tested on Linux.

CREDITS:
♦ spacechase0's Object Time Left was used as a starting point. 1.0.1
