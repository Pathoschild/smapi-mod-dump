  "Rainy_Day_Krobus": "Ah, It's more humid today with the rain... I feel a lot more comfortable.",
  "Rainy_Night_0": "On nights like this, those who gaze out windows sometimes see shadowy figures. To think... it might've been me.$7",
  "Rainy_Night_1": "If the other shadow people knew about our living arrangement, they would... 'punish' me.$s#$e#Most of them despise humans, you know.",
  "Rainy_Night_2": "You're sopping wet, and cold! Isn't that dangerous to your species?$s",
  "Rainy_Night_3": "I already had dinner, but it wasn't something you'd be able to eat... sorry.",
  "Rainy_Night_4": "Ever since I left my people, I've been searching for a new home... now I belong somewhere. That means everything to me.",
  "Rainy_Night_5": "It's said that my people came here long ago, when a great catastrophe allowed spirits from the void to cross into the physical plane.",
  "Rainy_Night_Krobus": "The sound of the rain reminds me of the sewers... it's comforting.#$e#The sewers were my refuge... I felt safe there. But don't worry... I feel the same way about my new home, too.",

  "Indoor_Day_Krobus": "I wish I could help you on the farm, but I can't go out in the sun...",
  "Indoor_Night_0": "I cleaned all the bugs out of the house today... Sorry, I didn't save you any! *smack*$7",
  "Indoor_Night_1": "You feel solid... sometimes I wish I had bones, too...$s",
  "Indoor_Night_2": "Sometimes I wonder if humans and shadow people could really ever co-exist... It's a lovely idea, but is it realistic?$s#$e#I hope so...",

  "OneKid_3": "I'm not sure how, but Yoba has blessed this house with a 'child'...",
  "TwoKids_0": "Don't worry... I already made %kid1 and %kid2 a void egg omelet.",
  "TwoKids_2": "I worry about the future of the children... But I trust that Yoba has a plan for them.",
  "TwoKids_3": "This house has been blessed with two children, now... Does that mean Yoba approves of our unconventional living arrangement?",
  "Good_1": "I feel a sensation in my body... is this... 'platonic love'?$l#$b#... Oh, wait... I'm just shedding my skin.$s",
  "Good_2": "I've learned to overcome my bias against humans... but Dwarves still disgust me.$a",
  "Good_3": "You started nibbling on me during the night, and mumbling about 'black lick or ish'... what did you mean by that?$3",
  "Good_0": "We're making progress, and I feel really hopeful.$h",

  "Neutral_1": "Do you think your Grandpa would approve of a monster living in his house?",
  "Neutral_2": "Do you think we could get in trouble for living together?$s",
  "Neutral_3": "It's so bright in here... I might close my eyes for a few hours.$s",
  "Neutral_4": "I can't go outside, I can only eat certain food, I need the temperature a certain way... I hope it's not too much of a bother to live with me, @.$s",
  "Neutral_5": "Welwick says I'm cursed today.$s",
  "Neutral_6": "I'll tell you a secret... I don't actually sleep, I just lay there with my eyes closed...",
  "Neutral_7": "You're a strange one, to want to live with a creature like me.",
  "Neutral_8": "I'm going to clean the house all day! This is fun.$7",
  "Neutral_9": "I wonder if we'll live here our entire lives? Moving would probably be too dangerous for me.",
  "Bad_1": "*sigh*... Maybe I should've stayed with my own kind.$s",
  "Bad_0": "...Do you still like me?$s",
  "Bad_2": "Are you still happy, living with me?$s",
  "Bad_4": "I think you'd be happier living with another human...$s",
  "Bad_5": "I've detected a change in your behavior... what does it mean? *groan*$s",
  "Bad_6": "You only have one short life to live... are you certain you want to spend it with a hideous creature like me?$s",

  "fall_Krobus": "It's been feeling a bit cooler lately, with a musty smell. You call this time of year 'fall', correct?",
  "winter_Krobus": "The darkness this time of year is very soothing. If only it were warmer!"
