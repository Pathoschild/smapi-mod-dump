  "summer_Fri4": "Whenever you catch a fish, take a moment to thank it for its sacrifice.#$b#Even if you don't believe in the spirit of the fish, it's a good mental exercise. We need to be aware of our effect on the environment.",

  "winter_Thu4": "Winter is tough, but you can still fish and forage to get by.#$e#If you have any animals you should keep them inside.",
  "winter_Fri4": "The trees go to sleep during the winter. It makes it a bit lonely out here.#$e#But I wouldn't deny them their beauty sleep.$h",
