  "Rainy_Night_0": "Hmm... seems like a good night to microwave a few pizza rolls.#$e#Some people like to cook them in the oven, but it just takes too long for me. Plus I like that squishy texture.$h",
  "patio_Shane": "Charlie's doing well.$8",
  "Rainy_Night_1": "The tip-tappa-tip of the rain takes me to a different time... a different place.",

  "Indoor_Day_2": "Do me a favor... when I pass away, use my dust to fertilize some corn for the hens.",
  "Indoor_Day_3": "*smooch*... Mmm, it tastes like someone's been nibbling on pizza rolls.$6",
  "Indoor_Day_4": "I may keep to myself a lot, and I may seem unhappy sometimes... but I do appreciate all the work you do. I'm a lucky guy.$6",

  "Good_5": "Ah... life on the farm sure beats working at Joja. That place was disgusting.$h#$e#You think it was depressing out front? Kid, you should've seen the back room...",
  "Good_6": "Ah... this is the life. No responsibilities, Tunnelers game tonight, fridge stocked with all the goodies a guy could need.$h",
  "Good_8": "I don't really feel like doing work today. Maybe I'll see what's on TV.",

  "Neutral_4": "What, you want me to clean the dishes? I'll do it... eventually...",
  "Neutral_5": "Are we doing okay on money? I don't want to have to go back to work at Joja.",
  "Neutral_6": "If you need to go see your friends in town, go ahead. I'm happy in the company of the TV and a couple of tall boys.",
  "Neutral_8": "Ugh... clean, clean, clean. Sweep, sweep, sweep. Bathe. Cook. Make the bed... Oh, well. Life's alright.",
  "Bad_5": "Look, I just want to be alone. Why don't you go outside and do your own thing for a while?",
