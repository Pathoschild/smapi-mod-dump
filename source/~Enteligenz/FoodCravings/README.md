# Food Cravings

Adds daily food cravings for the player, which, when fulfilled, result in a strong buff for half a day.
Optionally, the player can enable hangry mode, which gives out debuffs as long as the craving is left unfulfilled.

Open TODOs:
* Summarize the buffs into a single buff if possible (with a custom icon and everything), although this is probably more doable in 1.6
* Translation
* Do pathings work fine for Linux? (for other mods too)

The idea for this mod comes from [Hubgiteded](https://github.com/StardewModders/mod-ideas/issues/1063).
