# BarleyZP's Stardew Mods

This is the home for all of my Stardew Valley mods. I only upload my mods to [Nexus](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/BarleyZP/about-me). Please do not upload them to other websites. Unless otherwise specified by a license file within a mod's folder, all rights are reserved by me to protect against reuploads. However, please reach out if you'd like to talk permissions to use portions of my code for mod compatibility or if you're interested in providing translation files!
