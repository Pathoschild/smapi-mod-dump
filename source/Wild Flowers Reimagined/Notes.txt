(sorry if I missed anything, got called away)
Other than possibly some tile data in the map assets that might say where to spawn static crops (I can't remember if they implemented that), the TMX format and map data shouldn't affect them. The maps are loaded from the asset, but never permanently edited, and they don't contain persistent data. C# changes to maps will be undone the next time a player enters and it reloads, so Stardew's map changes are applied every time a GameLocation is reloaded.

From what I recall offhand, the basic logic for crops is: each `GameLocation` (e.g. the farm) has a list of `TerrainFeature` instances. When ground is tilled with the hoe, a `HoeDirt` terrain feature is created and added to the list. When players try to plant a seed, a `Crop` instance will be created and stored inside that tile's `HoeDirt` in a crop field.
