# WildflowersReimagined

Originally inspired by [Aedenthorn Wild Flowers](https://github.com/aedenthorn/StardewValleyMods/tree/master/Wildflowers) https://github.com/aedenthorn/StardewValleyMods/tree/master/Wildflowers

# Install
Install the latest version of SMAPI.
Download this mod and unzip it into Stardew Valley/Mods.
Run the game using SMAPI.


# How to use
Each day a random number of flowers will appear on grass patches. 

## Configuration
You can use Generic Mod Config Menu or edit the `config.json` file. This are the options:
- `ModEnabled`: controlls if the mod is enabled or not
- `WildflowerGrowChance`: Controllls the probability that a grass patch grows a flower. In the config file `0.123` is equal to `12.3%%`
- `FlowerGrassConfig.UseScythe`: Controlls if the harvest should be done by a Scythe

# Limitations
- The flowers don't count for Beehives to make Honey
- It doesn't include Forable Flowers ( Sweet Pea, Crocus ) as they don't have a seed id
- Right now Generic Mod config entries are only abailable on English, howerver I18n module is available, so feel free to contribute translations
- Multiplayer have not been tested.
- Linux/macOS have not been tested, Let me know if they work!

# Compatibility
- Works with Stardew Valley 1.6 on Windows.
- Works in single-player
- It should work with any modded Flowers as long as they have seeds as well.
