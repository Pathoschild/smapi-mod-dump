# Multitool
## What is it?
Multitool is a Stardew SMAPI mod, originally created as an alternative to AlmightyTool. Point at the tile you want to act on and press a button, and Multitool choses the right tool and uses it.

## How to install it
   * Install the latest version of SMAPi from [smapi.io](https://smapi.io) or [NexusMods](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2400).
   * Download this mod and unzip it into Stardew Valley/Mods.
   * OR Download and install with Vortex
   * Run the game using SMAPI.

## Using Multitool
   * Hover your mouse cursor over the object or location you want to use the tool on. Press 'Q' and Multitool will chose a tool and use it.  If Multitool can't figure out which tool to use, it will take no action.
   * To use an upgraded tools features, like watering an area, use the tool by hand first. Multitool will then use the same power or area level.
   * Press 'I' over a location to see the information Multitool has about a location
   * Edit config.json to change the button mappings

## Compatibility
Works with Stardew Valley 1.6 and SMAPI 4

## Features and Known issues
   * When using the watering can, there is an animated trickle of water in front of the farmer. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
   * The button can be spammed to do actions very fast.  It's a bit cheaty, but that's how I like it.  Beware running out of stamina!  I recommend [Auto-Eat](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/643) by Permamiss if you want to avoid fainting.
   * When you don't have a tool in your inventory, Multitool will act like you have the basic tool. This allows you to keep using it even when your actual tool is being upgraded by Clint.
   * Cutting grass is currently not supported.
