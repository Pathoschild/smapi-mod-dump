* Make the scythe crafting recipe disappear after the quest closes
* Harpoon casting graphics are broken
* It'd be nice if we could get Sebastian working under the tractor
* Add conversation topics for NPC's after hearts are gained -
 - Wizard cops to not needing to run around
 - Dwarf talks about shoes
 - Sebastian thanks for doing something for the community
* In multiplayer, it'll probably take a game reload for other players to get new tractor capabilities.
