# The Return of Immersive Sprinklers

This project is a "fork" of [Immersive Sprinklers](https://github.com/aedenthorn/StardewValleyMods/tree/master/ImmersiveSprinklers), a Stardew Valley mod originally from aedenthorn.

The purpose of this fork is basically to make it compatible with version 1.6 of SV, which was released on March 19, 2024.
