# Managing Mini Fridges
Access mini fridges through the kitchen fridge using inventory tabs. Simply place mini fridges in a farm house or cabin with a kitchen and they will be accessible from the kitchen fridge. The next day you will find your placed mini fridges moved away from your living space. They are placed in the first found free tiles within the house when the day ends so if the mod stops working you should still have your stuff. It should also work in multiplayer.


# Requirements:
SMAPI 3.1+
Stardew Valley 1.4+

# In-Game Instructions:
Place mini fridges inside a farm house or cabin with a kitchen.
