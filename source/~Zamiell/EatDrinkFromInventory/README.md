# Eat & Drink From Inventory

A mod for [Stardew Valley](https://www.stardewvalley.net/) that allows food and drinks to be consumed from the pause screen by pressing a hotkey. Additionally, it automatically pauses the game once the consumption animation is completed and returns you to the same facing direction that you were before.

By default, the hotkey is bound to Q, but this can be changed through the [Generic Mod Config Menu](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5098) (or by editing the "config.json" file).

(It also allows you to use warp totems and staircases in the same way.)

This mod is [available to download at NexusMods](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/?).
