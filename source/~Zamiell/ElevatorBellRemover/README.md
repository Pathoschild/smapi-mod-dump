# Elevator Bell Remover

A mod for [Stardew Valley](https://www.stardewvalley.net/) that removes the bell sound effect when using an elevator.

This is useful because the bell sound quickly becomes infuriating when farming for a specific type of enemy.

This mod is [available to download at NexusMods](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/21268).
