# Highlighted Objects

A mod for [Stardew Valley](https://www.stardewvalley.net/) that highlights [Preserves Jars](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Preserves_Jar), [Kegs](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Keg), [Casks](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Cask), and [Crystalariums](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Crystalarium) when nothing is inside of them.

This is useful because when filling these items at scale, it can be easy to miss filling a stray one.

This mod is unpublished.
