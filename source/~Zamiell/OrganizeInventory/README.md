# Organize Inventory

A mod for [Stardew Valley](https://www.stardewvalley.net/) that organizes the inventory into a specific order upon pressing a hotkey.

Currently, the hotkey is hard-coded to O and the inventory order is hard coded. If you want to change it, you need to recompile the mod.

This mod is not yet published.
