# Auto Animation Cancel

A mod for [Stardew Valley](https://www.stardewvalley.net/) that automatically performs an animation cancel when swinging a tool on the optimal frame.

However, it does not animation cancel a scythe, since the optimal time to cancel would be dynamic based on the current hitbox that you want to have.

This mod is considered to be cheating and should only be used in a tool-assisted speedrun setting (or similar).

This mod is not yet published.
