# Shift Toolbar When Paused

A mod for [Stardew Valley](https://www.stardewvalley.net/) that allows you to shift the toolbar when the game is paused. (In the vanilla game, it prevents you from doing this.)

This mod is [available to download at NexusMods](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/21613/).
