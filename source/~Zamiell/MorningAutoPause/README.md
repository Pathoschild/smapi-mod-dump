# Morning Auto Pause

A mod for [Stardew Valley](https://www.stardewvalley.net/) that automatically pauses the game at the beginning of the day.

This is useful since the game can lag when first loading the day, wasting precious in-game seconds.

This mod is [available to download at NexusMods](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/21266/).
