# Swap Rings

A mod for [Stardew Valley](https://www.stardewvalley.net/) that swap rings upon pressing a hotkey.

- This mod swaps the first two rings in your inventory with the two rings that are currently equipped.
- If only one ring is in your inventory, then it will only swap out the first ring.
- If no rings are in your inventory, the hotkey will do nothing.

By default, the hotkey is bound to Z, but this can be changed through the [Generic Mod Config Menu](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5098) (or by editing the "config.json" file).

This mod is [available to download at NexusMods](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/21205).
