# Automatic Screenshot Taker

A mod for [Stardew Valley](https://www.stardewvalley.net/) that automatically takes a screenshot upon reaching a new floor in the mines or Skull Cavern. This is so that you can immediately see what the layout of the floor is.

This mod is [available to download at NexusMods](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/10460).

You can use this mod in conjunction with an [automatic image viewer](https://github.com/Zamiell/image-viewer). By putting the image viewer on your second monitor, you can automatically view the entire floor as soon as you enter it without having to do anything extra.
