# Visible Artifact Spots

A mod for [Stardew Valley](https://www.stardewvalley.net/) that draws a red border around [artifact spots](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Artifact_Spot), making them easier to see.

This mod is [available to download at NexusMods](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/21223).

## Legality

This mod is not considered cheating because in the vanilla game, you can pause the game upon reaching a new location and take a screenshot. Then, you can study the screenshot and look through it for artifact spots while the game is paused and no in-game time is passing. Doing this is necessary for optimal play but is incredibly tedious. Thus, this is just a quality-of-life mod to make the process easier.

## Comparison to Other Mods

There are other mods that change the sprites of artifact spots to make them easier to see. However, doing this replaces the spritesheet as a content modification. Since this mod draws a new border around the existing sprite, no content modifications are necessary, making this mod more resilient to base game updates.
