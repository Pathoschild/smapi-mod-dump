		The first entry before the : is the translation key, leave that one unchanged. Only change the translation in the "" behind it.
		Every value that you don't translate (or that is missing when I update) will simply take the english translation I wrote.

		\n means insert a line break (you can see I use line breaks in the gmcm config menu because it doesn't do that automatically).
