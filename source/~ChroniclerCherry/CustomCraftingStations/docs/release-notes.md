# Release notes
## 1.2.0
Released 19 March 2024 for SMAPI 4.0.0 or later. Updated by Pathoschild.

- Updated for Stardew Valley 1.6 and SMAPI 4.0.0.
- Improved compatibility with mods that change crafting menus.

## 1.1.1

## 1.1.0
Released 17 June 2020 for SMAPI 3.5.0 or later.

- Changed the menu to a custom one.  
  _This means there is little to no chance of other mods that edit/replace the crafting menu from breaking CCS or vice
  versa. However, this means that extra features added to the crafting menu from other mods won't be applied to custom
  crafting stations. I will work specifically on compatibility with other mods as the demand arises-- but I think a base
  of "Works, with special compatibility bridges added in over time" is better than it constantly breaking._
- Fixed some bugs.
