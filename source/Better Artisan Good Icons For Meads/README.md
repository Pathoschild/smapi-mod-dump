# Better Artisan Good Icons - Mead Addon

## Overview

This mod is an addendum to [Better Artisan Good Icons](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2080). It allows BAGI to also load flower-dependent sprites for different meads.

It uses the same `Flowers` field which BAGI natively uses for honey textures. If your content pack already includes a `honey.png` file, simply add a `mead.png` file with your desired mead sprites, ensuring they follow the same order and layout as the honey sprites. Otherwise, add the `Flowers` field to your `data.json`, and list the flower names in the same order as they appear in your spritesheet.
Example content packs can be found in the [Content Packs](https://github.com/daleao/bagi-meads/tree/main/Content%20Packs) folder.

Please note that this mod alone does not change Keg behavior, or otherwise add flower meads to the game.
For that you will also require a mod like [Flower Meads](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5767) or [Quality Artisan Products](https://www.moddrop.com/stardew-valley/mods/707502-quality-artisan-products).

## Installation

1. Make sure that [Better Artisan Good Icons](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2080) is installed.
