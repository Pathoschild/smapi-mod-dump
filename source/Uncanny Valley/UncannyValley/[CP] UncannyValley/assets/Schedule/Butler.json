*		This is required to have your character to move about Stardew Valley.  It can be a simple move to point A to point B, however						*
*		you may also add animations that you create from animationDescriptions and your spritesheet.  There is also an option to give						*
*		your NPC something to say in certain places. Below is a sample of Hiroshi's schedule.																*
