## Translations
My native language is russian. As you can see, my english is so-so. If you want to help me with some translation fixes or add your language in the mod - feel free to ping me in Discord(!MrVeress#7408) or in Github(https://github.com/mrveress). Always glad to meet someone new in my life!)

## Assets
My pixelart is great (no) as you see. If you want to add your theme in assets not only for yourself - ping me in Discord or in Github. If your work will be greather than mine (any other will be better hehe) - I will make your work as default theme for future releases. But make sure that you understand, that in future releases I'll add new machines and ping you for adding new images into your asset (or I will do this by my hands, and you will be not happy with this lol).

- New types of machines (Seeds extractor from the trash or other crazy ideas. Btw, you can help me with ideas :smile:)
- Per-save configs (Separated settings for each save file)
