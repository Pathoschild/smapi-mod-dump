# Custom Winter Star Gifts
A framework that allows you to change the gifts given by NPCs at the Feast of the Winter Star.

Via content packs, you can now edit the gifts given at the Feast of the Winter Star, be it a diamond, a bar of iridium, or even just a piece of trash! Customise to your heart's content, or install other peoples' content packs with fun and creative gifts at the Feast.
