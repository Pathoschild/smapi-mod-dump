**Better Crab Pots** is a [Stardew Valley](http://stardewvalley.net/) mod that lets you customize what can be found in [Crab Pots](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Crab_Pot).

This mod is unmaintained and was extremely poorly written, it will never get updated.  
P.S. The code is truly awful, please don't look at it.
