**Animals Need Water** adds functionality to water troughs located in animal houses. Water them and your animals will be happy! Though, if you ignore them, your animals won't like it - they don't really enjoy being thirsty.

## Install
 -  [Install the latest version of SMAPI](https://smapi.io/).
 -  Install Animals Need Water [from Nexus mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/6196).
 -  Run the game using SMAPI.

## Uninstall
Simply removing mod's folder will work.

## API
**Animals Need Water** provides an API allowing modders to access data like *which animals were left thirsty yesterday* or *coops/barns with watered troughs*.

See [API docs](https://github.com/gzhynko/StardewMods/blob/master/AnimalsNeedWater/API-documentation.md) for more info.

**Contributing**
If you'd like to help me translate the mod, here's how:

 1. Copy the `default.json` file from the `i18n` folder with one of the following names, depending on the language you choose to translate the mod to: 
	|  Language | File Name |
	| -- | -- |
	|  Chinese | `zh.json` |
	|  French | `fr.json` |
	|  German | `de.json` |
	|  Hungarian | `hu.json` |
	|  Italian | `it.json` |
	|  Japanese | `ja.json` |
	|  Korean | `ko.json` |
	|  Portuguese | `pt.json` |
	|  Spanish | `es.json` |
	|  Turkish | `tr.json` |
 2. For each `key` translate the `value` . For example:
	``` 
	"dummy-key": "dummy-value"
	    ^- key     ^- value,
	                  translate this
	```
	Please *don't* translate the `{{tokens}}`.
	
 3. Start SMAPI to test your translation. If everything seems to work OK, you're good to go!
 
 After you are done translating, you can either create a new pull-request or issue here *or* [email](mailto:gleb.zhinko@gmail.com) me your translation file and I'll credit you as the author of the translation.
