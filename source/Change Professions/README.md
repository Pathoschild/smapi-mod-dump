# Stardew-ChangeProfessions

This mod makes it easy to change professions in Stardew Valley.

Normally when you mouse over a profession on the skill page you get a small pop-up showing the current profession. With this mod you can click on this profession pop-up to reopen the level up menu for this profession, giving you the ability to choose again.

Keep in mind that the secondary profession (level 10) of a skill is based on which primary profession (level 5) you picked. Changing a primary profession will therefore also change the secondary profession.

# Compatibility
* Requires [SMAPI](https://smapi.io/).
* Supports multiplayer and controllers.
* Partially compatible with Cooking Skill and Luck Skill. It works, but changing those professions isn't yet supported.
