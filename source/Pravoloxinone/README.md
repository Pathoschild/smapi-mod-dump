# Pravoloxinone #

This is a mod for Stardew Valley to introduce the mentioned Pravoloxinone item.

We've all seen the sign in Harvey's clinic, but what exactly is pravoloxinone? Why would you want to drink it?

With this mod, Pravoloxinone is finally a reality and slightly more dangerous than advertised! Harvey will send you the recipe for this mysterious medicine and start selling it in the clinic for 2000g after you've seen his 4 heart event.

### And why drink it? ###
Because it's fun!

### ...Seriously, why should I drink it? ###

Pravoloxinone may give the following effects (with the default chance in brackets):
- (20%) Inflict a random debuff for 60 seconds, these will stack.
- (65%) Add a random skills buff of varying level for 10 minutes, these won't stack.
- (10%) Inflict damage between 10 and up to half your health. This won't kill you but can bring you down to 1HP.
- (5%) Dissolve all your bones! Harvey has something to say about this!

May the odds be in your favour! 

Buffs added by pravoloxinone are considered 'drink buffs' so they will stack with food item buffs but be overridden by drink buffs. They will also override drink buffs when applied.

### And the recipe? ###
To make it you will need
- 1 Energy Tonic
- 1 Muscle Remedy
- 1 Mayonnaise

If you do die due to drinking Pravoloxinone, the death cutscene will be slightly different.

### Config: ###
The chances for each of Pravoloxinone's effects may be altered using the config file or through GMCM.

Values are in the form of a decimal where the number is a fraction of 100. E.g. 1.0 = 100% chance or 0.45 = 45% chance

GMCM will only allow changes in increments of 0.025, more minor adjustments must be made in the config file directly. To prevent issues, keep config values within 3 decimal places.

When editing the config, the value of all the options must add up to be equal to 1.0 (as the chance of any effect applying must be 100%), the mod will use default values if not.

### Installing: ###
- Download the mod
- Extract the contents of the .zip download into your 'Mods' folder
- Enjoy!

### Uninstalling: ###
- Just remove from your mods folder, any Pravoloxinone items will become error items which can be safely trashed.

### Compatibility: ###

- Multiplayer compatible
- No known mod conflicts
- Fully translatable! Only in English so far.

The mod does use Harmony, just FYI
