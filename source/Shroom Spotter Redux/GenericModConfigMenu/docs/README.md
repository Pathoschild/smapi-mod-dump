# Generic Mod Config Menu
A config menu framework for mods. Changes are live - after saving, restarting the game is not
necessary.

A button is added to the title screen in the bottom left to access the config menus.

The way it is written allows for this mod to be added as an optional dependency, so your mod can
still run without this one.

Example usage [here](https://gist.github.com/spacechase0/2d8d4dbffe5f2ce9457d2c891a8b99e3/) (with
API at the bottom).

Note that support is opt-in; if a mod doesn't show up on here, the mod creator needs to add support
for it.
