Theft of the Winter Star

Someone stole the deocrations for the Feast of the Winter Star!

Lewis will tell you about once Winter starts (or anytime before Winter 25) when you leave your farm
house. He'll guide you to where you need to go to proceed.

## Solution
Right click on the bag in the second room to get the first key. (This can be done again for the
first frosty stardrop piece.)

For the room with the three pedestals, you can put in (in order): Frozen Tear, Solar Essence, Void
Essence for a frosty stardrop piece, key, and Festive Scepter. You can also bomb the wall for
another frosty stardrop piece.

In the room with the boss door, head left and solve the maze for the boss key (half A). The door in
the top-left leads to a target you need to hit with a projectile for a frosty stardrop piece.

In the room with push block puzzle, you need to push a white block onto the blue tile for the boss
key (half B). You can also bomb the wall for another frosty stardrop piece.

(Craft all frosty stardrop pieces together in your crafting window for a Frosty Stardrop.)

Put the boss key halves onto the pedestals to open the door and fight the boss.

Beating the boss gives you half a heart with the entire town, and a recipe for the Tempus Globe.
