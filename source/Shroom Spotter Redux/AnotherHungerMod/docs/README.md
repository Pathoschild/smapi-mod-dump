# Another Hunger Mod
This mod adds a hunger system to the game.

Fullness cap of 100, losing 0.8 every 10 minutes. Eating food restores fullness based on its
edibility value, which is what the game uses to calculate stamina and health restored.
(Essentially, the more stamina it restores, the more fullness it restores.

When you have over 80 fullness, you get a speed, defense, and attack buff.  
When you have below 25 fullness, you get a speed debuff.  
When you reach 0 fullness, you start taking starvation damage.

Starving to death resets your fullness to 25.

ADDITIONALLY. You have to feed your spouse each day. If you don't, you take a relationship hit of
50 points.

Most all numbers are configurable.
