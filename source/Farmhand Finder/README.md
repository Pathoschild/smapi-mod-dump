# **FarmhandFinder**

## Description 
Ever needed to give someone an item only to end up aimlessly running around in an attempt to locate them? This mod attempts to solve this mild annoyance by adding a compass pointing to players in the same location as you (while hopefully not being another annoyance?). As an introduction...

![img](https://i.imgur.com/6ONgpJg.gif)  
**Here is an example of how the compass would appear in game!** *(Unlike this demo, however, it will appear at the edge of the screen)*

**The compass also dynamically changes per player to reflect their current appearance!** *(Hats included for fun!)*

**Additionally, the compass hides when colliding with a UI element!** *(In an effort to reduce obtrusiveness—hopefully.)*
