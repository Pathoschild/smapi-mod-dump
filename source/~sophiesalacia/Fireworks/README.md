## Fireworks (2023 Mod Jam Collab)
*by sophie*

[NexusMods](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/15277)

This is not a standalone mod - it is the C# component of the New Year's Eve mod created by Yri, Airyn, shekurika, LenneDalben, beyondrecovery, TiaKall, and myself for the Stardew Valley Discord 2023 Mod Jam.
