# Theme Manager

![](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1303/images/14525/14525-1668812423-343155290.png)

Theme Manager has three main jobs. First, it makes it possible for content packs to modify
hard-coded colors used in in-game UIs. Second, it makes it easy for other C# modders to allow
content packs to modify their in-game UIs. Finally, it modifies text rendering to
keep text crisp.
