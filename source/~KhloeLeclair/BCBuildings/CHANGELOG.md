# Changelog

## 2.5.1

* Fixed: Building upgrades not functioning correctly.


## 2.5.0

The "increment to 2.5.0 because SMAPI is being weird" update! Sorry for
people getting mod update available notices, when there wasn't one.

* Changed: Pre-register our recipe types to reduce the performance impact
  when opening the crafting menu for the first time.

  new 'NEW' indicator.
