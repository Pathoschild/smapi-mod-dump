## Description
The Shipping Bin Summary Mod is a modification for Stardew Valley that enhances the gameplay by displaying the total amount of money you will receive for the items in your shipping bin when you hover your mouse cursor over it. This convenient feature provides you with a quick overview of your earnings without the need to open the bin and calculate.

## Features
Displays the total value of the items in your shipping bin.
Saves time by eliminating the need to open the shipping bin to check its contents.
Supports all items that can be sold through the shipping bin.

## Installation
Install SMAPI: Ensure you have [SMAPI](https://smapi.io/ "SMAPI") (Stardew Modding API) installed on your computer.

Download the Mod: Download the latest version of the Shipping Bin Summary Mod from the [Releases Page](https://github.com/futroo/Stardew-Valley-Mods/releases/tag/ShippingBinSummary "Releases Page") or from [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/18992 "Nexus Mods")

Install the Mod:

## Compatibility
