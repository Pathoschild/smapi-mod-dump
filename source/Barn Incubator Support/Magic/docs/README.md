## Use
This is an early release. It may be unbalanced and/or buggy.

### Unlock magic
To unlock magic, visit the wizard with three hearts or more. The magic UI should appear in the
bottom-left corner right after the event. Then visit the [altar](screenshot-altar.png) in Pierre's
shop and equip some spells by dragging a spell onto the hotbar along the right side of the menu.

To get the mana potion recipe, visit the adventurer's guild.

Hints on using the Analyze spell to unlock more spells appear on the TV.

### Use magic
To cast a spell, hold `Q` and press a number key (`1` through `4`) corresponding to the spell's
position in the hotbar. Press `Tab` to swap between spell sets.

### Professions
You gain magic XP by casting spells. Leveling up increases your mana regen rate, and unlocks some
professions:

* Level 5: Potential (+2 spell upgrade points).
  * Level 10: Prodigy (+2 spell upgrade points).
  * Level 10: Memory (adds a fifth spell per spell set).
* Level 5: Mana Regen I (doubles mana regen speed).
  * Level 10: Mana Regen II (triples base mana regen speed).
  * Level 10: Mana Reserve (+500 max mana).

## Compatibility
Compatible with Stardew Valley 1.5+ on Linux/macOS/Windows, both single-player and multiplayer.
