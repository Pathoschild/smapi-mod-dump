Ever wondered why there aren't any profession overhaul mods on the Nexus? Me too.


## Features

- Rebalanced and reworked [almost] every profession to be an equally unique and attractive choice.
- Each profession targets a specific style of gameplay, some which were not viable in vanilla (i.e. ranching).
- No more ~~boring~~ uninspiring flat value bonuses.
- Bomberman mining; Assassin, Sniper and Slime-army combat.
- Scaling end-game objectives.
- Level 5 professions provide simple early-game buffs that benefit most styles of general gameplay.
- Level 10 professions are more specialized and engaging, providing two bonuses which change the way you play.
- Professions are more consistent across the board, with several analogous perks and synergies.
- Lightweight. This mod is built with a dynamic event handling system to avoid overhead.
- New icons for most professions, courtesy of [IllogicalMoodSwing](https://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/user/38784845-illogicalmoodswing/) (please make sure to [endorse their original](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/4163)﻿ mod).


## Professions

### ![](https://i.imgur.com/p9QdB6L.png) Farming

- **Lv5   - Harvester** - 10% chance for extra yield from harvested crops.
- **Lv10 - Agriculturist** - Crops grow 10% faster. Grow best-quality crops organically without fertilizer.
    - Chance for iridium quality is unchanged from vanilla and is equal to half the chance for gold. Fertilizers will still massively increase that chance.
- **Lv10 - Artisan** - All artisan machines work 10% faster. Ship quality artisan goods to improve your brand value over time.
    - Every artisan good shipped is worth a number of points based on its value and quality. Accumulating enough points will have your goods be recognized in the Stardew Artisan Fair's Seasonal Awards. Their stamp on your products can be worth a premium of up to 40% extra value. You will receive a congratulatory mail from the Stardew Artisan's Society upon winning a new award.
- **Lv5   - Rancher** - Befriend animals quicker.
    - Double mood and friendship from petting. Newborn animals are born with some starting friendship.
- **Lv10 - Breeder** - Animals incubate faster and breed more frequently. Increase value of animals at high friendship.
    - Mammals are twice as likely to give birth and oviparous (egg-laying) animals incubate twice as fast. At max friendship animals are worth 2.5x their base price instead of vanilla 1.3x.
- **Lv10 - Producer** - Happy animals produce twice as frequently. Produce worth 5% more for every full barn or coop.
    - Note that happiness (mood) is not the same as friendship, and that animals cannot produce more than once per day. Bonus value applies to artisan goods derived from animal produce. There is no limit to the scaling.

### ![](https://i.imgur.com/jf88nPt.png) Foraging


- **Lv5   - Forager** - 20% chance for double yield of foraged items.
- **Lv10 - Ecologist** - Wild berries restore 50% more health and energy. Learn to identify forage of higher-quality over time.
    - All foraged items will have the same quality for immediate inventory convenience. Quality starts off at silver and increases when enough items have been foraged.
- **Lv10 - Scavenger** - Location of forageable items revealed. Occasionally track buried treasures.
    - On switching maps while outside you will occasionally detect hidden buried treasure. Find it and dig it up (with a hoe) within the time limit to obtain your reward. The larger your win streak the better your odds of obtaining rare items. Bonus: hold LeftShift (or LeftShoulder on gamepad) to reveal all forageables on-screen.
- **Lv5   - Lumberjack** - Felling trees yields 25% more wood.
- **Lv10 - Arborist** - All trees grow faster and can drop hardwood.
    - Bonus tree growth works as a global buff (applies to all farmhands) and stacks in multiplayer with multiple Arborists.
- **Lv10 - Tapper** - Tappers are cheaper to craft. Tapped trees give syrup 25% faster.

### ![](https://i.imgur.com/TidtIw0.png) Mining

    - Bonus is 10% after reaching the bottom of the Mines, and continues to scale indefinitely.
- **Lv10 - Prospector** - Location of ladders and mining nodes revealed. Occasionally track special rocks.
    - Analogous to Scavenger. Will track any mining nodes or mineral forages off-screen with a yellow pointer, and any ladders or shafts with a green pointer. On entering a new mine floor you will occasionally detect stones with prospective treasure. Find the stone and break it within the time limit to obtain your reward. The larger your win streak the better your odds of obtaining rare items. Bonus: hold LeftShift to highlight nodes and ladders on-screen.
- **Lv5   - Blaster** - Bombs are cheaper to craft. Exploding rocks yields twice as much coal.
- **Lv10 - Demolitionist** - Bomb radius +1. Exploding rocks yields 20% more resources.
    - Bonus: get excited when hit by explosions.
- **Lv10 - Gemologist** - Identify gems and minerals of higher quality. Crystalariums work 25% faster.
    - Analogous to Ecologist. All gems and minerals mined from nodes have fixed quality, starting at silver and increasing once enough minerals have been collected. Applies to Crystalariums and Geode Crushers, but not to geodes broken at Clint's.

### ![](https://i.imgur.com/XvdVsAn.png) Fishing

- **Lv10 - Aquarist** - Fish pond max capacity +2. Fishing bar height increases for every fish pond at max capacity.
    - Gain 6 pixels per Fish Pond. Every four ponds equal a permanent cork bobber.
- **Lv5   - Trapper** - Crab pots are cheaper to craft. Can trap higher-quality haul.
    - All trapped fish can have quality up to gold. Chance depends on your fishing level.
- **Lv10 - Luremaster** - Crab pots no longer produce junk items. Use different baits to attract different catch.
    - Each type bait will attract different catch:[list]

        - **Wild bait:** 10% chance to catch fish up to level 90 (i.e. anything but legendary fish and octopus). 50% chance to double your catch.
        - **Magnet:** repel all fish, but attract metal items dragged by the currents. Traps resources, artifacts, treasure chests, rings and even weapons.
        - **Magic bait:** 25% chance to catch fish above level 70, excluding legendary fish. Removes all location and seasonal restrictions for catching fish. Makes all catch iridium-quality.
- **Lv10 - Conservationist** - Crab pots without bait will trap junk. Remove junk from bodies of water to gain village favor and tax deductions.
    - Every 10 junk items collected from Crab Pots increases friendship with all villagers by 1. Every 100 junk items collected will earn you a 1% tax deduction the following season (max 37%), increasing the value of all shipped goods. You will receive a formal mail from the Ferngill Revenue Service every season informing your tax deduction.
