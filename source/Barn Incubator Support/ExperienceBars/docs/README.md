### `config.json` file
The mod creates a `config.json` file in its mod folder the first time you run it. You can open that
file in a text editor to configure the mod. If you make a mistake, you can delete the `config.json`
and it'll recreate a default one.

Here's what you can change:

field | description
----- | -----------
`ToggleBars` | The button which shows or hides the experience bars display.
`Position` | The x and Y pixel position at which to draw the experience bars, relative to the top-left corner of the screen.
`BaseColors` | The colors to use for the general experience bars UI. Each color is described as a [RGBA value](https://rgbacolorpicker.com/). The foreground is set by `SkillColors`.<br />![](color-options.png)
`SkillColors` | The colors to use for each skill. This doesn't apply to custom skills added by other mods, whose colors are specified by those mods.

## Compatibility
Compatible with Stardew Valley 1.5+ on Linux/macOS/Windows, both single-player and multiplayer.
