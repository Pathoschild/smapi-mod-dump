**Luck Skill** is a [Stardew Valley](http://stardewvalley.net/) mod which reimplements the game's
unimplemented luck skill and adds professions for it.

## Install
1. Install the latest version of...
   * [SMAPI](https://smapi.io);
   * and [SpaceCore](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1348).
2. Install [this mod from Nexus Mods](http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/521).
3. Run the game using SMAPI.

## Use
Just like the normal skills, the luck skill appears on the player tab of the game menu, and you
can level it up and choose professions. You get luck skill based on your daily luck (what the
fortune teller TV channel mentions), when you fish up treasure, and when you crack open a geode.

### Available professions
* Level 5: Fortunate (better daily luck).
  * Level 10: Shooting Star (Nightly events occur twice as often).
  * Level 10: Lucky (20% chance for max daily luck).
* Level 5: Un-unlucky (Never have bad luck).
  * Level 10: Popular Helper (Daily quests occur three times as often).
  * Level 10: Spirit Child (Giving gifts makes Junimos happy; 15% chance for some form of farm advancement).

### Effects
The luck skill affects...

* fishing treasure (chance of treasure appearing, larger stack sizes, and better rings);
* panning;
* something to do with lightning;
* items you get from mineshaft stones;
* chance of getting gold-star fish;
* the wheel spin minigame at the Stardew Valley Fair;
* the slots minigame at the Casino;
* the chance to get buff from warrior ring;
* the amount of wood from cutting trees;
* extra harvests from non-scythe crops (?);
* stuff dropped on death in mines (?);
* items dropped on death resulting in hospital (?);
* Level 8: Lucky lunch recipe (?) and cooking channel in spring 28 of year 2);
* yoba ring buff;
* crit chance;
* ore dropped;
* random coal drops;
* chance of spouse finding out you gave someone else dateable of the same gender a gift (-30 relation points).

Food that buffs luck affects most (but not all) of this.
