## Use
Visit the beach on summer 5 to start [the festival](screenshot-festival.png). When you're ready,
talk to Lewis to start the [surf race](screenshot-surfing.png).

Don't put anything weird in the bonfire.

**Known issues:**
* Before the race, the text explaining the powerups extends past the textbox. It still works as
  intended, it's just a bit harder to read the bottom word.
* When using the Stardrop powerup, your character may jump forward and backwards. That's a bug due
  to how fast you're going.

## Compatibility
Compatible with Stardew Valley 1.5+ on Linux/macOS/Windows, both single-player and multiplayer.
