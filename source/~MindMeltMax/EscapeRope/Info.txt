This mod was originally requested by Kissa, who also made the escape rope sprite.

I never intended to release it myself but felt like it should see the light of day in some way.

Inside the release folder you'll find the only build I'll "publish", unless something happens which breaks the mod

Use of the sprite in other mods is prohibited unless permission is given by Kissa
