       Updates
       
       * Re-wrote fish nets bait serialization (and all the stuff that came with that)
       * Removed fish net offset serialization (should be backwards compatible)
       * Fixed fish nets bug where jellies, junk, or weeds could have quality
       * Update fish nets - automate to reflect changes to fish nets
       + Added config option for fairy fix toggle overlay button (which should've been in the initial version)
