Shop ideas:
* Robin sells furniture
* More art for Leah
* Sandy sells... something
* Marnie sells animals
* Willy sells fish instead of fishing bits
* Leo's island shop

Market rendering
* two markets a day
* villagers come to sides of shops
* track villager's intended arrival tile and only pause them there
* fix flash of content when chest is/isn't displayed
* Option for random number of shops each market day
* tint the sign

Mail and conversations:
* write tutorial here
* in-game tutorial
* send a mail on the day before the first fair
* shut the market down properly at closing time, empty the granges
* letter after market to summarize sales
* Conversation topic after market day e.g. Pierre is pissed
* interactions with buyers

Market mechanics:
* boost price if item is in season
* Make a shop with your spouse/roommate
* samples sell product
* Variable pricing, supply/demand response
* Critics and reviews
* Gain friendship if items bought while you're there


## c/o Airyn

Faye could have a clothing stall and Kimpoi could have a sapling stall?
Oh, Jeric could have a seed & produce stall too
(also if you want more ES/Lemurverse characters, it'd be hilarious if Juliet had a stall selling stuff she's shoplifted from JojaMart ðŸ˜‚)
