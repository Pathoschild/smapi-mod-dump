Junimos will hoe your fields, grow wild trees for timber, look after your fruit trees, clear debris, and mow the lawn


Better Junimos Forestry

Junimos are the keepers of the forest, and now they can grow a forest or fruit orchard (or just a giant field of turnips) for you.

    grow crops around trees -- good for your environment, good use of space
    sustainably harvest wood, never run out
    take care of twigs, rocks, and debris


Drop a Junimo hut into the middle of your messy, uncleared, unhoed field and let the Junimos sort it out!

Normal mode:

    collect dropped objects (fiber, stone, clay, ...)
    harvest debris (twigs, rocks, ...)
    cut grass


Crops mode:

    hoe the entire field

    cut down any trees
    fill it with crops


Orchard mode:

    plant fruit trees
    clear debris to keep fruit trees growing
    when trees are grown, grow crops around them


Forest mode:

    plant wild tree seeds
    fertilize wild trees
    hoe around wild tree saplings, grow crops in the spaces
    when tree is fully grown and seeded, harvest it for wood and replant
