## Skull Cavern Toggle

This mod allows the Skull cavern difficulty to be toggled between the harder version and the normal version after the Skull Cavern Invasion challenge has been completed, similar to how the mine difficulty can be changed at the Shrine of Challenge

The change is immediate, and applies to everyone in multiplayer (If you are in the Skull Caverns the next floor encountered will be the new difficulty)

The default key to toggle the difficulty is z, this can be configured in the config file which generates after the game is run once.
