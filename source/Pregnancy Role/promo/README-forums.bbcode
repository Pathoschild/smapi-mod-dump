[i]a [url=http://stardewvalley.net/]Stardew Valley[/url] mod by [url=https://www.kdau.com]kdau[/url][/i]

People of all genders may or may not be able to become pregnant. This mod gives Stardew Valley farmers and NPCs the full range of possibilities.

Pregnancy Role does not change the chance or timing of baby proposals between spouses. However, if and when a proposal for a new baby is made, whether the spouse is an NPC or another player, this mod will affect what happens. There will be a pregnancy only if one of the spouses can become pregnant and the other spouse can make pregnant. In any other combination, there will be an adoption instead.

If you need to hide or reposition the "Pregnancy Role" dropdown on the Skills tab and/or the Social tab detail page, you can edit this mod's [icode]config.json[/icode] file. It will be created in the mod's main folder ([icode]Mods/PregnancyRole[/icode]) the first time you run the game with the mod installed. These options are available:
[list]
[*][icode]ShowPlayerDropdown[/icode]: Set to [icode]false[/icode] to hide the "Pregnancy Role" dropdown for the player on the Skills tab.
[*][icode]PlayerDropdownOrigin[/icode]: Set the [icode]X[/icode] and [icode]Y[/icode] values to pixel coordinates, relative to the top left of the game menu, where the dropdown should appear. Coordinates (0,0) mean that the position will be calculated automatically.

[*][icode]SpouseDropdownOrigin[/icode]: Set the [icode]X[/icode] and [icode]Y[/icode] values to pixel coordinates, relative to the top left of the detail page, where the dropdown should appear. Coordinates (0,0) mean that the position will be calculated automatically.
