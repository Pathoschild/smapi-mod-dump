# Release Notes

## Version 1.0.1

* Better compatibility with controllers:
    - Don't leave behind a phantom rainbow area when the cursor is supposed to be hidden
    - Show the rainbow cursor pointer instead of the (non-colorized) controller finger pointer
* Patch UI Info Suite 2 because it's stupidly doing its own cursor drawing

## Version 1.0.0

Iniital release
