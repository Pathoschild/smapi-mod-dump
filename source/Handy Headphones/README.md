# Handy Headphones

**Handy Headphones** is a mod for [Stardew Valley](http://stardewvalley.net/) that adds a hat which let's you play any in-game music you'd like, anywhere! 

## Install
1. [Install the latest version of SMAPI](https://smapi.io/).
2. [Install all the dependencies](#dependencies).
3. Install [this mod from Nexus mods](http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/7936).
4. Run the game using SMAPI.

## Using the Headphones & Earbuds
To purchase either hat, visit the hat shop.

To use the headphones or earbuds, simply equip them and a prompt will appear to select a soundtrack. If you unequip the item, the normal music will play.

To change the music track you selected, you can right click the headphones or earbuds while wearing them to bring up the prompt again.

Additionally, the headphones / earbuds will let any event music play and resume your selected track when the event ends.

There is a third hat, called studio headphones, that allows you to play all the in-game sounds with the background music muted. This may be useful for modders!
