       Migrated mod .csproj to .net5 for monogames SDV port.
       Removed lots of unnecessary code from Revitalize for simplification. May add it back in later.
       Removed all of the Omegasis. namespace prefixes
       Rewrote most of the animation rendering system to not be so messy and be more simplified.
