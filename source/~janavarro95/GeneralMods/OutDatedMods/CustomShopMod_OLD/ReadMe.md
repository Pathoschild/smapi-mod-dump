[SMAPI]CustomShopMod

-v0.0.2 4/3/16 1:53 AM PST (I need to seriously stop programming so late).

-Initial alpha release. Works as is, could use some improvement.
  -Just fixed a bug where I wasn't calculating max items correctly. leading to a false error.

This is the CustomShop mod! What it does is add in a simple command called shop_mod that reads shop data from (store_name).txt located in StardewV Valley/Mods/CustomShopMod!

The formatting is a bit picky because values have to be placed in a certain order in order for this mod to work, so I left 2 pre-configured shops for players to play around with.

This tool will hopefully be useful to modders/players who wish to get their item in the game without some form of cheating/save hacking.

adding a new shop is simple enough. Simply make a new .txt file, and start the shop's data on the fourth line. Adding more items for that specific shop.txt is as simple as copying and pasting to te end of the .txt file. (see examples provided).

As always I'll see if I can try and improve on this one a little in the future. I don't know how to make UI's yet so this mod is stuck to the command window for now...
