 "message":"Hey @, ^ I saw that you built an upgraded home for your animals! If you are thinking of wanting to buy more animals then you'll want to make sure they are well fed with lots of delicious hay. Come by my shop and I'll start selling you Hay Makers which can turn fiber, corn, wheat, and amaranth into tasty hay! \n It also will automatically put the hay into any silos on your farm! Additionally don't forget you can always purchase hay from the hay maker outside of my shop whenever you need, but I'll need to charge a bit more for the machine upkeep costs. Best of wishes! ^ -Marnie",
