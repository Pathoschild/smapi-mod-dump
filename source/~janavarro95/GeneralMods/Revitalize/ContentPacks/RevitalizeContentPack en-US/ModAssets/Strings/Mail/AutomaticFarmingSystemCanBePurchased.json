	"message":"Hey @, ^ I've been working on a new invention that should help you out on your farm! This new system and all of the accessories that compliment it should help you grow your crops with ease by automating the farming for your garden pots once you upgrade them to this new self watering variety! \n I told mom to start selling the blueprints to them in her shop to you when you come by. Sorry they are a bit pricey, a lot of money went into my research for these so I hope you understand. Best of luck! ^ -Maru",
