**Night Owl** is a [Stardew Valley](http://stardewvalley.net/) mod which lets you stay up a full
24 hours instead of collapsing at 2am, including a morning light transition as the sun rises.

Compatible with Stardew Valley 1.2+ on Linux, Mac, and Windows.

## Installation
1. [Install the latest version of SMAPI](https://github.com/Pathoschild/SMAPI/releases).
2. Install [this mod from Nexus mods](http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/433).
3. _(optional)_ Merge the `Content` folder into your game's `Content` folder to improve night fishing.
3. Run the game using SMAPI.

## Usage
Simply stay up past 2am, and you won't collapse. The lighting will gradually brighten as the sun
rises. At 6am you'll temporarily collapse so the game can save, but you won't lose anything and
you'll stay where you are.

Edit the `config.json` to change the mod settings.
