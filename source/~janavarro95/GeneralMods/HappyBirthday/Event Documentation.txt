Here lets take Leah's dating event for example

"stardewEventID": 19954 is critical because it controls what events the Player has and hasn't seen in the game. All of these numbers range from 0-65537 I believe due to a weird quirk in the game's code. The thing that is unfortunate is that this id needs to be unique, so the 19954 was a random number I made up. I would recommend making up a number say 30000 and going from there to make all of the event ids. So in essence chose a number from 0 to 65537 and you should be fine. Each event must have a unique id though! 

"eventStringId": "HappyBirthday_Events_BirthdayParty_Dating_Leah" Is a unique identifier I use in the mod to keep track of each individual event. It works like the stardewEventID in that it needs to be unique per the event, but is a collection of words. The exact words don't matter, but it's so that the mod can recognize and keep track of all of the mod events it has seen.
For example you could do Happy_Birthday_SDV_Expanded_Compatibility_By_<YourNameHere>_Dating_<NPC_Name_Here> and it would work perfectly fine

"version": 2 Doesn't actually matter anymore. That's some leftover data from when the event files were part of the mod's main folders so you can either put a value of 1 here or not. Just make sure you keep that field there otherwise there might be some odd side effects.

"EventData": ... Is all of the actual event information passed into the game to run the events. if there is a specific part that needs to be explained, I'm happy to assist since I know I added some custom event commands with the mod that aren't documented on the wiki.

"EventPreconditionData": ... Is all of the conditions that need to be met for the event to be ran. This is something I wrote for the mod to add flexibility for checking things like the Player's birthday. Also happy to explain this one, but hopefully some of the names are mildly intuitive. ðŸ™‚

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Breakdown of Event Preconidition data present.

Omegasis.HappyBirthday.Framework.EventPreconditions.FarmerBirthdayPrecondition This check tells the event to occur only if it is the player's birthday.

StardustCore.Events.Preconditions.GameLocationPrecondition LeahHouse This check tells the event to occur only at a specific location in the game. In this case, it's Leah's house, but some game locations can have odd names. If you are doing this for Stardew Valley Expanded, unfortunately I don't know the names of those game locations, so I can't be much help there.

StardustCore.Events.Preconditions.TimeSpecific.TimeOfDayPrecondition 600 2600 This is the time of day the event can occur if you have specific time restrictions. 600 is 6:00 AM and 26:00 is 2AM when the player passes out. This basically says the event can happen all day!

StardustCore.Events.Preconditions.NPCSpecific.DatingNPC Leah This condition checks to see who the player is dating at the time, in this case, Leah!
