# BigCropBonus

Do you keep your Giant Crops around cause you like them? Now you get a benefit for doing so!
Giant crops in the world make the base crop sell for more.

## Description

If Giant cauliflower, melon, and pumpkin, etc. are present, then give a +10% of selling price for the crop and their related products. This stacks!

Percentage can be edited in config.json (0.1 is 10% per, 1.5 is 150% per, etc.)

Supports custom giant crops from other mods! (Tested with <https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5221>)

Won't work in multiplayer with split wallets... yet! Still learning how, and will update as soon as I can!

- v0.1.4 - Multiplayer support! Healing effect and friendship points get boosted as well! Supports cooked items made from the crop as well!
- v0.1.3 - Fix selling to shops and add updated prices to tooltips
- v0.1.2 - Tweaked test mode info
- v0.1.1 - Updated .zip to release build
- v0.1.0 - Initial release
