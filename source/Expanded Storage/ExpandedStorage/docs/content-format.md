## Expanded Storage Content Format

### Contents

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Expanded Storage](#expanded-storage)
* [Storage Tabs](#storage-tabs)
* [Sprite Sheet](#sprite-sheets)
* [Context Tags](#context-tags)

### Overview

An Expanded Storage content pack must contain the following files:

- `manifest.json`
- `expanded-storage.json`
- `storage-tabs.json` (Optional)

Each Storage must be added to the `BigCraftables' folder in the
[Json Assets](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1720) Big Craftable format:

- `BigCraftables\Storage Name\big-craftable.json`
- `BigCraftables\Storage Name\big-craftable.png`

#### Manifest.json

`manifest.json` must specify this is a content pack for Expanded Storage:

```json
"ContentPackFor": {
  "UniqueID": "furyx639.ExpandedStorage"
}
```

For full details of `manifest.json` refer to
[Modding:Modder Guide/APIs/Manifest](https://stardewcommunitywiki.com/Modding:Modder_Guide/APIs/Manifest).

#### Expanded-Storage.json

`expanded-storage.json` is used to enable/disable Expanded Storage features for Storages:

```json
{
  "Storage Name": {
    "Capacity": -1,
    "CanCarry": true
  }
}
```

For full details of `expanded-storage.json` see [Expanded Storages](#expanded-storage).

#### Storage-Tabs.json

`storage-tabs.json` is used to provide definitions for Storage Tabs:

```json
{
  "Crops": {
    "TabImage": "Crops.png",
    "AllowList": [
      "category_fruits",
      "category_vegetables"
    ]
  }
}
```

For full details of `storage-tabs.json` see [Storage Tabs](#storage-tabs).

### Expanded Storage

Expanded Storages are loaded into the game using
[Json Assets](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1720).  
It's also possible to load storage or enable features using the [Expanded Storage API]().

```json
"Capacity": 72,
"CanCarry": true,
"AccessCarried": true,
"VacuumItems": true,
"ShowSearchBar": true,
"IsPlaceable": true,
"OpenSound": "openChest",

"SpecialChestType": "None",
"AllowList": [],
"BlockList": [],
"Tabs": ["Crops", "Materials", "Other"],
"ModData": {
  "ModDataKey": "ModDataValue"
}
```

### Storage Tabs

```json
"TabName": {
  "TabImage": "Crops.png",
  "AllowList": [
    "category_greens",
    "category_flowers",
    "category_fruits",
    "category_vegetables"
  ],
  "BlockList": []
}
```

field           | description
----------------|-------------
`TabName`       | Name of the object, must match the Big Craftable name. **(Required)**
`TabImage`      | Number of item slots this storage supports. `-1` will be treated as infinite items, `0` will use the default vanilla value. (default 0)
`AllowList`     | Restrict chest to only accept items containing these [tags](#context-tags). (default `null`)
`BlockList`     | Restrict chest to reject items containing these [tags](#context-tags). (default `null`)

#### Localization

Tab Names can be localized under the `i18n` folder:

- `i18n\default.json`
- `i18n\fr.json`

```json
{
  "Crops": "Crops Translated",
  "Cooking": "Cooking Translated"
}
```

#### Assets

Custom Tab Images can be saved under the `assets` folder:

- `assets\Crops.png`
- `assets\Cooking.png`

### Config Options

Config options may be enabled/disabled to override the default config. If both
enabled and disabled are specified then disabled will take precedence. If
neither are specified then the global config will apply.

field               | description
--------------------|-------------
`AccessCarried`     | Open the chest menu while item is currently being held. (default `disabled`)
`CanCarry`          | Allows this storage to be picked up when it contains items. (default `enabled`)
`ShowSearchBar`     | Add a search bar to the chest menu for this storage. (default `enabled`)
`ShowTabs`          | Add a search bar to the chest menu for this storage. (default `enabled`)
`VacuumItems`       | Storage will collect dropped items directly into it, bypassing the backpack. (default `disabled`)

### Sprite Sheets

A sprite sheet is a single image with frames that span horizontally and layers which span vertically. If a sprite sheet is not defined, then storages will revert back to using the regular sprite sheet that is loaded using Json Assets.

These sprite sheets should be saved in the mods `assets` folder.

#### Storage Dimensions

This sprite sheet is automatically used to determine the object's dimensions.

The width of the object is determined by `Total Image Width รท Frames`.

If `PlayerColor` is set to `false` the height of the object will be `Total Image Height`.  
If `PlayerColor` is set to `true` the height of the object will be `Total Image Height รท 3`.

#### Animation Frames

The left-most frame will always be the object at rest, and every frame after is animated when the storage is opened.

#### Player Color

When `PlayerColor` is set to `true` then the spritesheet must include three rows of sprites.

row | sprites
----|---------
1   | Default render when no player color choice is made.
2   | Base layer that will be rendered with the player's color choice.
3   | Drawn over the Base layer, but without the player's color choice.

### Context Tags

The game adds various [context tags](https://stardewcommunitywiki.com/Modding:Context_tags) to every item. The recommended way to find what context tags are supported by which items is to install [Lookup Anything](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/541) and enable it's [ShowDataMiningFields](https://github.com/Pathoschild/StardewMods/tree/stable/LookupAnything#configure) option. Then simply press `F1` while hovered over any item to find it's data.

Below are some of the more useful tags:

description     | tags
----------------|------
Category        | `category_clothing`, `category_boots`, `category_hats`, ...
Color           | `color_red`, `color_blue`, ...
Name            | `item_sap`, `item_wood`, ...
Type            | `wood_item`, `trash_item`, ...
Quality         | `quality_none`, `quality_gold`, ...
Season          | `season_spring`, `season_fall`, ...
Index           | `id_o_709`, `id_r_529`, ...

Additionally the following custom tags are supported:

tag                 | description
--------------------|-------------
`category_artifact` | Custom tag to select for any Artifacts.
`category_furniture`| Includes regular furniture items with this tag even though the game doesn't normally add it.
`donate_bundle`     | Selects any items that are missing from the Community Center Bundle.
`donate_museum`     | Selects any items that can be donated to the Museum.

### Mod Data

All items support a key-value store known as Mod Data. You can initialize values for your storage to integrate with features from mods. This will only add the modData when the item is originally obtained or crafted, and it will not override if a value already exists.

Of course Mod Data opens a world of possibilities depending on the mod, but here are a few notable examples:

key                                             | description
------------------------------------------------|-------------
`Pathoschild.ChestsAnywhere/IsIgnored`          | If `true` storage will be de-listed from Chests Anywhere .
`Pathoschild.ChestsAnywhere/Category`           | Storage will automatically be added to a Category.
`Pathoschild.Automate/StoreItems`               | If `"disable"` Automate will not store items in this storage
`Pathoschild.Automate/TakeItems`                | If `"disable"` Automate will not take items from this storage
