# BuildableForge

Allows building a magical Enchanting Forge like Ginger Island's Caldera Forge. This lets you apply Forge Enchantments to your tools, and whatever else you can enchant.

To build the building, first you must reach the Ginger Island Volcano Caldera, and unlock the Wizard's selection of magical buildings with the Magic Stamp.

The building costs 1,000,000 Gold, 100 Cinder Shards, 10 Iridium Bars and 1 Prismatic Shard. This is editable in the EnchantingForgeBlueprint.json in the assets folder.

Currently only supports English.

Compatible with Combine Many Rings and Many Enchantments.
