# Modular Overhaul Change Logs

This file contains a TL;DR of individual module changelogs. Only major changes are reiterated here. For the complete list of changes, please refer to the individual changelogs of each module, linked [below](#detailed-change-logs).

## Major Release 2.0.0 Highlights

* Weapon, Slingshot and Enchantment-related functionalities have been refactored to specific modules.
    * Added Weapons module.
    * Added Slingshots module.
    * Added Enchantments module.
    * Added Combat module.
    * Removed Arsenal module.

## Minor release 1.4.0 Highlights

* [Arsenal]: Certain weapons have been rebalanced, including Galaxy and Infinity weapons.
* [Arsenal]: Several tweaks to make new weapons significantly easier to come by.
* [Arsenal]: No longer requires manual execution of `revalidate` command.
* [Rings]: Adjustments to Chord Harmonization logic, leading to a rebalance of certain gemstone combinations. The tetrads, in particular, have become significantly stronger.
* [Taxes]: Added property taxes.
* [Tools]: Now includes the popular Harvest With Scythe feature, so you no longer have to rely on CJB Cheats Menu's implementation. The implementation is similar to Yet Another Harvest With Scythe Mod, which means they will conflict if installed together.
