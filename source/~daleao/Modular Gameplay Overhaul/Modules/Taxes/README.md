# Modular Overhaul :: Taxes

</div>

## Overview

This mod implements a simple taxation system to the game, because surely a nation at war would be on top of that juicy end-game income.

The Ferngill Revenue Service (FRS) will calculate your due Federal obligations based on your Shipping Bin income. This adds a new gameplay element and a reason to prefer doing business locally, and also affords the player a choice to become a tax evader.

The FRS defines seven tax brackets for the individual taxpayer, modeled after the United States Of America (if you are curious, google what they are). By default, the highest bracket for income tax is 37% (the latter value is configurable, although the number of brackets is not).

Federal obligations will be deducted automatically from the farmer's balance. However, the FRS is not unsympathetic to the local businessman, and so Federal obligations will not be charged until the 2nd of every season. This means the farmer has one day to reinvest the closing season's profits into new seeds for the current season, before ~~being robbed by~~ making their contribution to the Federal Government. If the farmer does not have enough funds at the end of the day to cover their due obligations, the FRS will seize the farmer's Shipping Bin income until the outstanding amount is settled, while also charging interest at a configurable rate (default 6% per annum).

If the [Professions](../Professions) module is enabled and the player has the Conservationist profession, the professions' tax deduction perk will change from a % value increase to all items, to a more immersive % deduction of taxable income. Environmentalist activities can be used to deduct taxable income up to 100%. This means that farmers can be tax-exempt by collecting enough trash from oceans or rivers (it is recommended to decrease the default Professions setting for TrashNeededPerTaxBonusPct, as the TaxBonusCeiling setting will be overridden to 100%).

(NEW) You can now deduct your business expenses from your taxable income. Any income spent on farm buildings, tool upgrades, animals or seed purchases (configurable) will be automatically deducted. You don't even need to be a tax evader in this economy.

## Compatibility

Should be compatible with anything (including [Ferngill Revenue Service](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/7566, but please don't try using both together).
