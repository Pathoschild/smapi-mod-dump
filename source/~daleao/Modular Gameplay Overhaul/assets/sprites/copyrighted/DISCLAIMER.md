This assortment of weapon textures is what I personally use.
It combines pieces and textures from Vanilla Tweaks (https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/10852) and Simple Weapons (https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/16491).
Credit to those goes respectively to Taiyokun and dendenhsmy.
Though I have their permission to use their textures, I cannot outright distribute them.
By keeping them "hidden" in this folder I continue to enjoy the convenience while hopefully avoiding plagiarism complaints.

If you find these textures and choose to use them, tell no one.
And also, please drop an endorsement to both mods above.
