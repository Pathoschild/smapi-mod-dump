# PNDS Changelog

## 4.1.0

* Added compatibility for [More New Fish](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/3578).
    * Tui and La can be placed together in the same Fish Pond.
    * If Tui or La is placed in a Fish Pond, the Fish Pond's capacity is set to 2, as there is only one of each, and together they maintain balance between Yin and Yang.
    * Tui and La do not produce roe. Tui produces Solar Essence, and La produces Void Essences. If placed together in the same Fish Pond, on days where both Tui and La both produce an essence, one Galaxy Soul will be produced instead.

## 2.5.0

### Added

* Mr. and Ms. Angler can now mate when placed together in a pond.

<sup><sup>[ðŸ”¼ Back to top](#pnds-changelog)</sup></sup>

## 1.0.4

### Fixed

* Fixed a major typo in Fish Pond Mod Data, which caused FamilyLivingHere and DaysEmpty data fields to overwrite each other. I can't begin to imagine all the problems this was causing, but I recommend everyone reset their ponds to be sure.

<sup><sup>[ðŸ”¼ Back to top](#pnds-changelog)</sup></sup>

## 1.0.2

### Changed

* Decreased the volume of metal bars thrown into radioactive ponds from 5 to 4 and doubled the capacity to 40 volume units. Each radioactive pond can now hold 40 ores, 10 bars, or a combination of both, for enrichment.
* Extracted subroutines out of monolithic patches.

### Fixed

* Fixed *again* positioning of fishes in Pond Query Menu.
* Algae produced by Algae ponds now stacks correctly, so you wont lose algae by not collecting for long periods of time.
* Fixed a typo in Reflector logic which caused an exception to be thrown with Teh's Fishing Overhaul.
* TFO integration should now handle Algae correctly.

<sup><sup>[ðŸ”¼ Back to top](#pnds-changelog)</sup></sup>

## 1.0.0

### Added

* Added DaysUntilAlgaeSpawn setting to the GMCM menu.
* Added RoeAlwaysSameQualityAsFish setting.

### Fixed

* Fixed an issue which caused invalid mod data leftover after changing a pond's fish type.
* Adjustments to the positioning of fish in Pond Query Menu.

<sup><sup>[ðŸ”¼ Back to top](#pnds-changelog)</sup></sup>

## 0.9.6

### Fixed

* "Fixed" (but not really) an error thrown during Fish Pond production logic. This is actually caused by vanilla's `Utility.consolidateStacks` method, which deletes non-colored Roe from the produce list for some reason. Because this just slightly nerfs Fish Pond production, and they're slightly too strong, I'm choosing to embrace the bug and just hide the error.

<sup><sup>[ðŸ”¼ Back to top](#pnds-changelog)</sup></sup>

## 0.9.2

### Changed

* The quality of produced roe is now less than or equal to the quality of the fish which produced it, instead of always being equal to it.

<sup><sup>[ðŸ”¼ Back to top](#pnds-changelog)</sup></sup>

## 0.9.0 (Initial release)

### Added

* The [Aquarist](../Professions) profession now adds a chance to boost the quality of newborn fishlings, so you may eventually breed high-quality fish from low-quality ones.

### Fixed

* Fixed a bug where the counter for spawning Algae in an empty Fish Pond would reset when reloading the save.
* Fixed a typo preventing TFO integration from applying, which in turn caused a conflict with it installed.
