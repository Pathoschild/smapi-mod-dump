# RNGS Changelog

## 2.5.6 <sup><sub><sup>[🔼 Back to top](#slngs-change-log)</sup></sub></sup>

### Added

* Added a compatibiltiy patch for Identifiable Combined Rings (removed the "Many" tag from Infinity Band).

## 2.4.0 <sup><sub><sup>[🔼 Back to top](#rngs-change-log)</sup></sub></sup>

### Added

* Added shield VFX to Yoba's Blessing.

### Fixed

* Yoba's Blessing shield no longer remains after the buff timer runs out.
* Removed the "+4 Immunity" text from Immunity Ring tooltip.
* Corrected and added some missing translation keys.
* Power Chord Infinity Bands now normalize resonance correctly. This means that each gem will not get the full resonance effect from both resonant pairs, but rather shares the resonance with its equal. In simple terms, this nerfs Power Chords from 40% - 33% stats, to 30% - 26.7%. Monotone rings (all equal gems) are the only way to maximize a single stat.

## 2.3.0 <sup><sub><sup>[🔼 Back to top](#rngs-change-log)</sup></sub></sup>

### Changed

* Thorns Ring will not longer be renamed if Ridgeside Village is installed.

## 2.2.0 <sup><sub><sup>[🔼 Back to top](#rngs-change-log)</sup></sub></sup>

### Added

* Thorns Ring can now cause Bleed. Renamed to "Ring of Thorns", because it just sounds better.
* Ring of Yoba no longer grants invincibility; now grants a shield for 50% max health when your health drops below 30%.
* Immunity Ring now grants 100% immunity, instead of vanilla 40%.

### Changed

* Warrior Ring now gains stacks on every kill (instead of 3 kills), but is capped at +20 attack.

## 2.0.7 <sup><sub><sup>[🔼 Back to top](#rngs-change-log)</sup></sub></sup>

### Added

* Added GetInfinityBand command.
* Added some resonance texture options.

### Fixed

* Fixed yellow-tint in colorless resonance glow.
* Fixed a bug where unequipping an Infinity Band could cause the resonance glow to stick around.

## 2.0.5 <sup><sub><sup>[🔼 Back to top](#rngs-change-log)</sup></sub></sup>

### Fixed

* Non-colorful ring glow setting should now work correctly.

## 2.0.4 <sup><sub><sup>[🔼 Back to top](#rngs-change-log)</sup></sub></sup>

### Fixed

* Fixed small Glow and Magnet ring recipes incorrectly creating their regular versions.

## 2.0.0 <sup><sub><sup>[🔼 Back to top](#rngs-change-log)</sup></sub></sup>

### Added

* Resonance text is now color-coded.
* Added crafting recipes for small Glow and Magnet rings.
* Added config option to remove the color from Infinity Band glow.

### Changed

* New chord harmonization algorithm now considers all note interactions, instead of only distinct notes. Some gemstone combinations will suffer a small rebalance due to this change.
* The richness of Tryads and Tetrads now yields a boost to the root note resonance (as mentioned in the description). This is now a much more appealing choice.
* "Craftable Glow and Magnet" setting, and "Immersive Glowstone" setting, as well as new small ring recipes, have been grouped under a single config setting: "Better Glowstone Progression".
* Level required to craft Glow and Magnet rings increased from 2 to 4, and for Glowstone Ring from 4 to 6.

### Fixed

* Fixed the Warrior Energy buff, which previously wasn't implemented at all.

## 1.0.0 <sup><sub><sup>[🔼 Back to top](#rngs-change-log)</sup></sub></sup>

### Changed

* Complete overhaul of the Resonance feature, now inspired by real Music Theory. This is now a major gameplay mechanic instead of a small flavor feature, and will hopefully add versatility to the new Infinity Band and encourage variability. See the [module description](README.md) for details.
