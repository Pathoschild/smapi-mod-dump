[size=6][font=bebas_neuebook]Overview[/font][/size]

This module is an extensive overhaul of vanilla professions and skills, and makes up the core of the overhaul. Almost every profession has been reworked to be an equally unique and attractive choice targetting a specific style of gameplay, many of which were simply not viable in vanilla (i.e., ranching). And while it is not guaranteed that an "optimal" path does not exist, the main goal is to create opportunities for diversified or themed strategies as well as engaging new gameplay mechanics. Gone are the [s]boring[/s] uninspiring +X% sell price bonuses, and in their stead we introduce bomberman mining, thief/assassin combat, truly epic sharpshooting and even Slime taming. The new professions are meant to scale with player, provide new end-game objectives and steer the player towards new playstyles.

By popular demand this module also introduces an immersive (and completely optional) **Prestige** system, which will eventually allow the player to obtain *all* professions and open up skill progression to level 20. Also added are unique special abilities for each combat profession, with accompanying new visual and sound effects.

This module was inspired by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/3959191?tab=about+me]Enai Siaion[/url]'s excellent [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1137]Ordinator[/url] mod for Skyrim, and borrows many ideas (and a few assets) from the likes of [url=https://www.leagueoflegends.com]League Of Legends[/url], [url=https://diablo2.blizzard.com]Diablo[/url] and the classic [url=https://ro.gnjoy.com/index.asp]Ragnarok Online[/url]. It also includes professions icons by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/users/38784845]IllogicalMoodSwing[/url] ([b]please visit and endorse [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/4163]Profession Icons Redone[/url]![/b]).

Integrations are provided out-of-the-box for several popular mods. See the [b]Compatibility [/b]section below for details.
This module is safe to enable or disable mid-save. All profession perks will be applied retroactively. However, please note that disabling this mod will have no effect on skill levels or acquired professions, so make sure to manually reset your skills and professions back to vanilla standards [b]before[/b] disabling, using provided console commands.

Perks in [color=#ffff00]gold [/color]refer to prestiged variants. When written in parenthesis, these perks [b]replace[/b], and do not stack with, their base variants.

[*][b][color=#D9EAD3][img]https://gitlab.com/daleao/sdv-mods/-/raw/main/Modular%20Overhaul/Modules/Professions/resources/assets/sprites/loose/harvester.png[/img]﻿ Harvester (Lv5)[/color][/b] - 10% [color=#ffff00](20%)[/color] chance for extra yield from harvested crops.
[size=1][spoiler]Yields an equivalent 10% monetary bonus to vanilla on average, but also provides value if you choose not to sell raw crops.[/spoiler][/size]
[*][b][color=#D9EAD3][img]https://gitlab.com/daleao/sdv-mods/-/raw/main/Modular%20Overhaul/Modules/Professions/resources/assets/sprites/loose/agriculturist.png[/img]﻿ Agriculturist (Lv10)[/color][/b] - Crops grow 10% [color=#ffff00](20%)[/color] faster. Grow best-quality crops organically without fertilizer.
[size=1][spoiler]Allows harvesting iridium-quality crops, normally only possible with Deluxe Fertilizer. The chance is half of the chance with Deluxe Fertilizer. This means that fertilizers are [b]not[/b] obsolete.[/spoiler][/size]
[*][b][color=#D9EAD3][img]https://gitlab.com/daleao/sdv-mods/-/raw/main/Modular%20Overhaul/Modules/Professions/resources/assets/sprites/loose/artisan.png[/img]﻿ Artisan (Lv10)[/color][/b] - Artisan machines work 10% [color=#ffff00](25%)[/color] faster. Machine output quality can be as good as input ingredient quality.
[size=1][spoiler]Quality output is based on Farming level. The lowest possible quality is 2 stages below the input quality, and the highest possible quality is 1 higher than the input quality. For reference, the chance to preserve quality at level 10 is 30%. There is a small chance to promote the input quality one stage. Note that the quality preservation perk is tied to the Artisan player, while the production time and quality promotion perks are tied to the machine itself; in other words, only Artisans themselves can preserve the quality of ingredients, but they can do so on any machine, whereas any non-Artisan player can benefit from faster production and quality upgrades, so long as they use a machine crafted by an Artisan player (ownerhsip requirements can be turned off in the configs).[/spoiler][/size]
[*][b][color=#D9EAD3][img]https://gitlab.com/daleao/sdv-mods/-/raw/main/Modular%20Overhaul/Modules/Professions/resources/assets/sprites/loose/rancher.png[/img]﻿ Rancher (Lv5)[/color][/b] - Befriend animals 2× [color=#ffff00](3×)[/color] quicker.
[size=1][spoiler]Gain double mood [i]and[/i] friendship points from petting. Newborn animals are also born with a non-zero, random initial friendship.[/spoiler][/size]
[*][b][color=#D9EAD3][img]https://gitlab.com/daleao/sdv-mods/-/raw/main/Modular%20Overhaul/Modules/Professions/resources/assets/sprites/loose/breeder.png[/img]﻿ Breeder (Lv10)[/color][/b] - Incubation 2× [color=#ffff00](3×)[/color] faster and natural pregnancy 3× [color=#ffff00](5×)[/color] more likely. Increase value of animals at high friendship.
[size=1][spoiler]At max friendship animals are worth 2.5x their base price, instead of vanilla 1.3x. If [b]Animal Husbandry[/b] is installed, gestation following insemination is also 2x [color=#ffff00](3x)[/color] faster.[/spoiler][/size]
[*][b][color=#D9EAD3][img]https://gitlab.com/daleao/sdv-mods/-/raw/main/Modular%20Overhaul/Modules/Professions/resources/assets/sprites/loose/producer.png[/img]﻿ Producer (Lv10)[/color][/b] - Happy animals produce 2× [color=#ffff00](3×)[/color] as frequently. Produce worth 5% more for every full barn or coop.
[size=1][spoiler]Note that happiness, or mood, is [b]not[/b] the same as friendship. Also note that this will [b]not[/b] allow certain animals (i.e., cows and chickens) to produce more than once per day. Bonus produce value also applies to artisan goods derived from animal products (such as cheeses, mayos and cloth), honey (bees are animals too), and meat from Animal Husbandry or PPJA Fresh Meat. Also also note that only deluxe buildings can be considered full, and only barns and coops owned by the Producer will be considered (ownership requirements can be turned off in the configs). There is no limit to this bonus value.[/spoiler][/size]

[*][b][color=#D0E0E3][img]https://gitlab.com/daleao/sdv-mods/-/raw/main/Modular%20Overhaul/Modules/Professions/resources/assets/sprites/loose/forager.png[/img]﻿ Forager (Lv5)[/color][/b] - 20% [color=#ffff00](40%)[/color] chance for double yield of foraged items.[size=1][spoiler]Other than the name, this profession is unchanged compared to vanilla.[/spoiler][/size]

Progressively identify forage of higher quality.
[size=1][spoiler]All foraged items will have the same deterministic quality, providing immediate inventory convenience. However, that quality will initially start out at silver, and progress to iridium as you gather foraged items. Unlike vanilla this perk will also apply to hoed forage (such as Winter Root, Snow Yams and Ginger), Coconuts shaken off palm trees, and mushrooms produced by Mushroom Boxes, but only if the cave owner (i.e., the host player) has the profession. It will likewise apply to crafted [b]Mushroom Boxes[/b] and [b]Mushroom Propagators[/b], if either of those mods is installed.[/spoiler][/size]
[*][b][color=#D0E0E3][img]https://gitlab.com/daleao/sdv-mods/-/raw/main/Modular%20Overhaul/Modules/Professions/resources/assets/sprites/loose/scavenger.png[/img]﻿ Scavenger (Lv10)[/color][/b] - Location of foragable items revealed. Occasionally detect buried treasure. [color=#ffff00]Time freezes during Scavenger Hunts.[/color]
[size=1][spoiler]Whenever you enter a new outside map there is a chance to trigger a short Scavenger Hunt for hidden buried treasure. Follow the purple HUD arrow to find the treasure and dig it up (using a Hoe) within the time limit to obtain a reward. The larger your win streak the better your odds of obtaining rare items, and also of spawning more forageables items. You can optionally configure the HUD arrows to only appear when holding a key (LeftShift by default). This will also highlight forageable currently on-screen for your convenience.

[size=1][spoiler]Other than the name, this profession is unchanged compared to vanilla.[/spoiler][/size]
[*][b][color=#D0E0E3][img]https://gitlab.com/daleao/sdv-mods/-/raw/main/Modular%20Overhaul/Modules/Professions/resources/assets/sprites/loose/arborist.png[/img]﻿ Arborist (Lv10)[/color][/b] - All trees grow faster. Normal trees can drop [color=#ffff00](twice as much)[/color] hardwood.
[size=1][spoiler]Bonus tree growth works as a global buff; i.e., all trees in the world are affected as long as any player in the session has this profession, and the effect will stack for all additional online players that share this profession. The hardwood bonus is inherited and uchanged from vanilla.[/spoiler][/size]
[*][b][color=#D0E0E3][img]https://gitlab.com/daleao/sdv-mods/-/raw/main/Modular%20Overhaul/Modules/Professions/resources/assets/sprites/loose/tapper.png[/img]﻿ Tapper (Lv10)[/color][/b] - Tappers are cheaper to craft. Tapped trees give syrup 25% [color=#ffff00](50%)[/color] faster.

[size=1][spoiler]Completely unchanged compared to vanilla.[/spoiler][/size]

[color=#ffff00]Also recover some health and energy with every mine level.[/color]
[size=1][spoiler]Plus 0.5% ladder chance per level. Bonus ladder chance resets every time you leave the mines. [b]This includes taking the stairs back to the mine entrance.[/b][/spoiler][/size]
[*][b][color=#FFF2CC][img]https://gitlab.com/daleao/sdv-mods/-/raw/main/Modular%20Overhaul/Modules/Professions/resources/assets/sprites/loose/prospector.png[/img]﻿ Prospector (Lv10)[/color][/b] - Location of ladders and mining nodes revealed. Occasionally detect rocks with valuable minerals. [color=#ffff00]Time freezes during Propsector Hunts.[/color]
[size=1][spoiler]Analogous to Scavenger. Tracks all mining nodes and mineral forages off-screen with a yellow pointer, [b]revealed[/b] ladders, shafts and panning spots (when outside) with a green pointer. Whenever you are in the mines there is a chance to trigger a short Propsector Hunt for hidden stone treasure. Follow the purple HUD arrow to find the correct stone within the time limit and break it up to obtain a reward. The larger your win streak the better your odds of obtaining rare minerals or artifacts, and also of spawning additional resource nodes in the mines. Successful completion of a hunt automatically reveals a ladder. You can optionally configure the HUD arrows to only appear when holding a key (LeftShift by default). This will also highlight mineral nodes and other tiles of interest currently on-screen for your convenience.

[size=1][spoiler]This aims to provide a new style of mining while attempting to compensate for the lack of coal without the vanilla Prospector profession.[/spoiler][/size]
[*][b][color=#FFF2CC][img]https://gitlab.com/daleao/sdv-mods/-/raw/main/Modular%20Overhaul/Modules/Professions/resources/assets/sprites/loose/demolitionist.png[/img]﻿ Demolitionist (Lv10)[/color][/b] - Bomb radius +1. Exploded rocks yield 20% [color=#ffff00](40%)[/color] more resources.
[size=1][spoiler]This aims to improve the bomberman style of mining while attempting to compensate for the lack of Geologist and Gemologist professions from vanilla. You can also manually detonate bombs by hlding down the Mod Key (default LeftShift); these bombs will not detonate until you release the key. As an optional bonus, the Pyromaniac in you will [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nlJuwO0GDs]Get excited![/url] when hit by an explosion.[/spoiler][/size]
[*][b][color=#FFF2CC][img]https://gitlab.com/daleao/sdv-mods/-/raw/main/Modular%20Overhaul/Modules/Professions/resources/assets/sprites/loose/gemologist.png[/img]﻿ Gemologist (Lv10)[/color][/b] - Progressively identify gems and minerals of higher quality. Crystalariums work 25% [color=#ffff00](50%)[/color] faster.
[size=1][spoiler]Analogous to Ecologist. All gems and minerals mined from nodes have a fixed quality, starting at silver and increasing to iridium as you mine. Please note that this bonus will only apply to gems or minerals that have been either physically mined, or produced by Geode Crushers owned by the Gemologist. Crystalariums and geodes opened by Clint will [b]not[/b] receive quality upgrades. The exception to this is Crystalariums already in production, which will all receive an equivalent quality upgrade whenever the owner reaches a quality milestone. The production time bonus for Crystalarium is likewise tied to the owner, and therefore only Crystalariums crafted by the Gemologist will receive that perk (ownership requirements can be turned off in the configs).[/spoiler][/size]

In multiplayer, [b]only counts Fish Ponds owned by the player with this profession. [/b]Legendary fish in ponds will only produce roe, unless another mod patches their FishPondData. An optional Fish Pond Data patch is provided in the downloads page. Extended families are also considered legendary, and can be raised in the same pond as their kin if [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/articles/1264]PNDS[/url]﻿ module is enabled.

[size=1][spoiler]All trapped fish can have quality up to gold. Chance depends on fishing level (same formula as forage). The Crab Pot recipe is unchanged from vanilla.[/spoiler][/size]
[*][b][color=#CFE2F3][img]https://gitlab.com/daleao/sdv-mods/-/raw/main/Modular%20Overhaul/Modules/Professions/resources/assets/sprites/loose/luremaster.png[/img]﻿ Luremaster (Lv10)[/color][/b] - Crab pots [b]with bait [/b]no longer produce junk. Use different baits to attract different catch. [color=#ffff00]60% chance to preserve bait.[/color]

[*][b]Wild bait:[/b] Same as above. 50% chance to also double the haul.

Clean the Valley's waters to merit tax deductions. [color=#ffff00]Also merit villagers' favor.[/color]
[size=1][spoiler]Every 100 (configurable) junk items collected will earn you a 1% tax deduction the following season (max 25%, also configurable). What a "tax deduction" means depends on whether [b][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/articles/1265]TXS[/url]﻿[/b] module is enabled; if it is enabled, a tax deduction works as you would expect, reducing your overall amount due. If this module is not enabled, then a tax deduction works as a % value increasing to all items shipped in the bin. If you quality for a deduction you will receive a formal mail from the Ferngill Revenue Service on the first of the season informing your current deduction rights. If using Automate, you may want to play with the `TrashNeededPerTaxBonusPct` setting to something more reasonable.[/spoiler][/size]﻿

[size=6][font=bebas_neuebook]Prestige[/font][/size]

If enabled, the [url=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/The_Sewers#Statue%20Of%20Uncertainty]Statue of Uncertainty[/url] is replaced by the [b]Statue of Prestige.[/b]

[center][img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1303/images/14470/14470-1670909907-508003492.gif[/img]﻿[/center]
Instead of changing your profession choices, the Statue of Prestige will reset your level 10 skills back to level 0, for a price. After resetting a skill, you will have to level up again to choose a different profession, but you get to keep every profession you've ever acquired (yes, including level 5). You will also find that leveling becomes progressively easier after each skill reset (or harder, depending on your config settings). By default, reseting a skill will also cause you to forget all associated recipes, but can also be turned off. For this incredible service, the Statue of Prestige will charge you 10,000g the first time, 50,000g the second, and 100,000g the third and last time, although the cost can also be configured. After performing three skill resets, you should have acquired all four level 10 professions simultaneously. As you reset and acquire new professions your progress will be reflected on the skills page menu, either by a new colorful star, or by a growing ribbon, depending on your settings.

Once you have acquired four stars, or the ribbon has reached its fourth stage, the level cap for the corresponding skill is raised to 20, allowing you to continue to develop your tool proficiency or max health. Other perks of higher levels include better odds of higher-quality crops, fishes and forage, a larger fishing bar, more berries foraged per bush, and longer-lasting special abilities (see below). On top of that, at levels 15 and 20 you will be able to choose a profession to [b]prestige[/b]. A prestiged profession grants improved perks or, in some cases, entirely new ones.

[center][img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1303/images/14470/14470-1670908621-2008495626.gif[/img]﻿[/center]
Only after all possible skills have had their level cap raised will the Statue of Prestige resume it's old behavior, by allowing you to change your prestige choices, for a modest fee of 20,000g (also configurable).

The entire Prestige system is optional. It may be turned off at any time, but keep in mind that doing so mid-game will not cause you to lose any already acquired professions, nor will it have any immediate effects on your skill levels. However your skill levels will be reduced to the regular cap of 10 the next time the save is loaded.

All custom mod skills based on SpaceCore are compatible with the skill reset feature, but cannot have their level cap raised above the regular 10. For skill mod developers, if you wish to provide prestiged professions you can do so by registering your skill via the provided [b]API[/b].


[size=6][font=bebas_neuebook]Limit Breaks[/font][/size]

In addition to their regular perks listed above, every level 10 profession in the Combat skill tree also grants a unique [b][url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak]Limit Break[/url][/b]. This special ability must be charged by performing certain actions during combat. You can track the current charge by the HUD bar labeled "L".

Note that, though all combat professions can be acquired via skill reset, only one Limit Break can be registered at any time; if the Combat skill is reset, you will be asked the moment you choose your next profession whether you wish to keep or replace your current Limit Break. The four Limit Breaks are:

After all possible skills have had their level cap raised, the Statue of Prestige will let you switch between the four Limit Breaks for free, though a cost can be configured.

Limit Breaks, as with the Prestige system, is also optional, and can be disabled entirely in the mod settings.

[size=6][font=bebas_neuebook]Frequently Asked Questions[/font][/size]

[b]Do Ecologist and Gemologist professions count forages/gems acquired before the profession?[/b]
   ﻿No.

[b]Do Artisan/Producer/Aquarist and similar professions based on ownership of a machine or building, apply retroactively to machines/buildings that have already been crafted/built?[/b]
   ﻿Yes.

[b]Can Luremaster and Conservationist work together?[/b]
   ﻿Yes. Otherwise the whole Prestige thing wouldn't make any sense.  
  
[b]Can I obtain all prestige professions simultaneously?[/b]
   ﻿No, sorry. Making tough choices is part of this mod's design.  
   ﻿You can cheat them in with console commands if you really want (`profs add -p all`).  
  
[b]Can I obtain all Limit Breaks simultaneously?[/b]
   ﻿Obviously not.

[b]What do Legendary Fish produce in Fish Ponds? How long do they take to multiply?[/b]
   ﻿They will obey whatever is set for them in the [url=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Fish_Pond_data]Fish Pond Data[/url] file.  
   ﻿By default they don't multiply, have no quests, and only produce Roe.  
   ﻿This can be changed to whatever you like by using Content Patcher to target FishPondData.  
   ﻿An example file is offered under the Optional downloads as a template for this.  
   ﻿It adds several valuable items to the possible produce list of each Legendary Fish, but doesn't change their spawn time or population quests.  
   ﻿You may customize this file to achieve your preferred behavior.

[b]I don't like X profession. Can I pick and choose between modded and vanilla professions?[/b]
   ﻿No. Each profession requires changing Vanilla code at several different locations, and making all of them toggle-able would require a lot of work and unnecessary overhead.

[b]Will you add compatibility for Deluxe Grabber Deluxe?[/b]
   ﻿No. That would require a lot of work I don't want to do as I'm not a fan of that mod.

[b]Will you increase the level cap beyond 20?[/b]
   ﻿No. That would be entirely meaningless. At level 20 your stamina consumption from tools is exactly zero (note that the Tools module actually prevents that, setting 0.1 as the floor value to prevent the Efficient enchantments from being completely useless). The only other benefits would be some more berries collected per bush, and a ridiculously large fishing bar, which already glitches out in the mid-20's. The main benefit of skill levels are crafting recipes and professions, and obviously there's no where left to grow in that regard.
