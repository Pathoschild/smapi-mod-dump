## Overview

This module was born as an extension to the [Rings](../Rings) module's rebalance. It brings analogous changes to gemstone enchantments. But much more than that, it completely overhauls all Prismatic Shard enchantments for Melee Weapons and introduces all-new enchantments for Slingshots.

All features are optional and can be toggled individually.

### Gemstone Forges

- **Jade Enchantment:** Buffed significantly, from +10% to +50% crit. power.
- **Garnet Enchantment:** Introduced, provided that the Garnet stone is installed via the optional file, granting 10% cooldown reduction.

### Melee Enchantments

Enchantments have been almost entirely overhauled. Hopefully these enchantments will provide more interesting gameplay options.

| Name      | Effect |
| --------- | -------|
| Haymaker  | *Unchanged from vanilla.* |
| Artful    | Improves the special move of each weapon.* |
| Blasting | Accumulates and stores half of the damage from enemy hits (before mitigation). If enough damage is accumulated, the next special move releases that damage as an explosion. |
| Bloodthirsty | Enemy takedowns recover some health proportional to the enemy's max health. Excess healing is converted into a shield for up to 20% of the player's max health, which slowly decays after not dealing or taking damage for 25s. |
| Carving   | Attacks on-hit reduce enemy defense by 1 (continuing below zero). Removes the armor from Armored Bugs and de-shells Rock Crabs. |
| Cleaving  | Attacks on-hit spread 60% - 20% (based on distance) of the damage to other enemies around the target. |
| Energized | Moving and attacking generates energy. When fully-energized, the next attack causes an electric discharge, dealing heavy damage in a large area. |
| Mammonite's | Attacks that would leave an enemy below 10% max health immediately execute the enemy, converting the remaining health into gold. This threshold increases by 1% with each consecutive takedown, resetting when you take damage. |
| Steadfast    | Converts critical strike chance into bonus raw damage (multiplied by critical power). |
| Wabbajack | Causes unpredictable effects.** |

\*
***Offensive Swords:** Can dash twice in succession. **Defensive Swords:** The next attack within 5s of a successful parry is guaranteed a critical strike. **Daggers:** Quick stab deals an additional hit. If [WPNZ](../Weapons) is enabled with rebalance option, all hits apply Bleed with 100% chance. **Clubs:** Smash area +50%. Enemies in range are stunned for 2s.*

\*\* *Examples: damage or heal the enemy; decrease or increase the enemie's stats; transfigure into a different enemy, creature or any random item (note: this can spawn illegal items).*

### Ranged Enchantments

The enchantments below are entirely new and unique to slingshots.

| Name       | Effect |
| ---------- | -------|
| Gatling    | Enables auto-fire.* |
| Magnum     | Fires enlarged projectiles. |
| Preserving | Does not consume ammo. |
| Quincy     | Attacks fire an energy projectile if no ammo is equipped. Only works near enemies.** |
| Spreading  | Consume one additional ammo to fire two additional angled projectiles. |

\* *Double-click/press and then **hold** the use-tool key to engage auto-fire.*

\** *Quincy projectile cannot crit nor knock back enemies, but is affected by damage modifiers. If [PROFS](../Professions) is enabled and the player has the Desperado profession, Quincy projectile will also be affected by Overcharge.*

## Compatibility

- **Not** compatible with other mods that introduce new enchantments, such as [Enhanced Slingshots][mod:enhanced-slingshots].
