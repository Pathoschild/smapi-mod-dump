### Added

### Changed

* Artful can now be applied to Slingshot. Artful enchantment changes:
    - **Stabbing Sword**: Can dash twice in succession.
    - **Defense Sword**: ~~Stuns enemies for 1s~~ Guarantees a critical strike on the next attack (within 5s).
    - **Dagger**: Applies bleeding on each hit (if WPNZ is enabled with Rebalance).
    - **Club**: Now also stuns enemies for 2s.
    - **Slingshot**: Stunning smack becomes a stunning swipe (larger area, easier to hit).
* Gatling enchantment fire speed is now the same as Desperado Limit Break (x2 buff). No longer engaged by holding a Mod Key. You can now engage auto-fire by double pressing and holding the fire key.
* Preserving enchantment now grants 100% chance to preserve (was 50%).

### Changed

* Vampiric echantment's healing is now more similar to Vanilla, occurring on monster slay and being based on enemy max health + a random factor. Unlike the Vanilla one, some healing will always occur. The overheal effect remains the same.
