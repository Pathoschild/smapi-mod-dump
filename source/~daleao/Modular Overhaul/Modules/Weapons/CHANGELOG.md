* Added compatibility for Romancible Rasmodia.

## 2.5.5 <sup><sub><sup>[ðŸ”¼ Back to top](#wpnz-change-log)</sup></sub></sup>

### Removed

### Changed

* Touched up some weapon textures.

## 2.2.6 <sup><sub><sup>[ðŸ”¼ Back to top](#wpnz-change-log)</sup></sub></sup>

### Added

* Added instrinsic enchantment to Neptune Glaive: feels like a crashing wave, dealing heavy knockback. Thanks to [Deadnoz](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/users/9502763) for the idea.
* Added config setting to allow depositing the Blade of Ruin.
* Added compatibility for [Simple Weapons](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/16491?tab=posts&BH=0).

## 2.2.5 <sup><sub><sup>[ðŸ”¼ Back to top](#wpnz-change-log)</sup></sub></sup>

## 2.2.3 <sup><sub><sup>[ðŸ”¼ Back to top](#wpnz-change-log)</sup></sub></sup>

### Added

* You can now change the difficulty of the Ruined Blade's damage-over-time.
* You can now change the difficulty of the Hero's Journey quest; i.e. the difficulty of completing each virtue trial.
* The Trial of Generosity can now also be completed by gifting NPCs. The trial will complete once the total value of gifts given reaches the specified gold amount. The host player can still complete this trial by purchasing the community upgrade (which will no longer count for farmhands).

### Changed

* The Hero's Journey quest now displays as a single quest with multiple objectives (like a Special Order), rather than separate quests for each virtue.

### Fixed

* Revised enable condition for ButtonPressedEvent, which should fix issues with FaceMouseCursor, SlickMoves and AutoSelection working if any is disabled.

## 2.2.2 <sup><sub><sup>[ðŸ”¼ Back to top](#wpnz-change-log)</sup></sub></sup>

### Added

* Added one more line of flavor text to the Wizard if the player ignores his warning and chooses to level-up the sword anyway.
* Added fall-back mail flags when the Dark Sword and Holy Blade are equipped, just in case.

### Fixed

* No longer forcefully restarts the Blade of Ruin quest by checking for events seen. This was not doing I wanted and wasn't even necessary. Fixes the bug where player were receiving the quest every time the save was loaded.
* Fixed an IndexOutOfRange error when using any weapon with VFX and ComboHits disabled.

## 2.2.1 <sup><sub><sup>[ðŸ”¼ Back to top](#wpnz-change-log)</sup></sub></sup>

### Changed

* Refactored some patchers into more specific namespaces, just for consistency.

## 2.2.0 <sup><sub><sup>[ðŸ”¼ Back to top](#wpnz-change-log)</sup></sub></sup>

### Added

* All daggers, as well as the Obsidian Edge, now have a chance to inflict Bleed status, causing enemies to take damage every second for 30 seconds. Bleeding effect stacks up to 10 times, dealing exponentially higher damage with each stack. 
* Lava Katana now has a chance to inflict Burn status on enemies, causing them to loose 1/16th max health per 3 seconds and halves their attack for 15 seconds.
* Upgraded Yeti Tooth to Mythic status. Now has a chance to inflict Chill status on enemies, slowing them for 3 second. If Chill is applied a second time during the duration, the enemy will receive Frozen status, preventing them from moving and attacking for 30 seconds. Hitting a frozen enemy deals double damage and cancels the effect.
* Next on "improving stabby sword controls": special thrust move will now auto-seek the hovered enemy if FaceMouseCursor setting is enabled.

### Changed

* Mythic weapons now all have instrinsic enchantments, and therefore can no longer receive Prismatic Shard enchantments at the Forge for balancing reasons. This includes the Insect Head, Lava Katana, Obsidian Edge and Yeti Tooth.
* Many weapons had their tier reduced, such that the only Mythic weapons now are those with a instrinsic enchantment. Several mythic weapons have received status effects (listed above, in Added section).
* In exchange, mythic weapons can no longer receive Prismatic Shard enchantments.
* Stabby sword thrust move will now automatically home-in on the hovered enemy if FaceMouseCursor setting is enabled.
* Increased the hitbox of Club's overhead smash hit (final combo hit).

## 2.1.1 <sup><sub><sup>[ðŸ”¼ Back to top](#wpnz-change-log)</sup></sub></sup>

### Fixed

* Enough people have suffered SpaceCore serialization issues to make it worth mitigating the risk. From now on, instrinsic weapon enchantments will be temporary removed before the game is saving. There is no need to persist them on the save anyway. This does not apply to enchantments from [ENCH](../Enchantments).

## 2.1.0 <sup><sub><sup>[ðŸ”¼ Back to top](#wpnz-change-log)</sup></sub></sup>

### Changed

* Warp Totem: Island recipe now requires one Radioactive Ore if Dwarven Legacy option is enabled (instead of one extra Ginger).

### Fixed

* Fixed a long-standing overlooked issue with weapon hitboxes during combos. Combat should feel *significantly* better now.
* Fixed Galaxy and Infinity weapons not being registered as Stabbing Swords right away.
* Can no longer dash in festivals.

## 2.0.6 <sup><sub><sup>[ðŸ”¼ Back to top](#wpnz-change-log)</sup></sub></sup>

### Fixed

* Looks like Galaxy / Infinity sword config settings were not quite fixed in the previous version.
* Fixed major issue in random stat calculation causing damage to appear incorrectly in menus and shops. No longer randomizes on instance construction.
* Increased Claymore damage slightly.
* Increased Steel Falchion damage slightly.
* Should now correctly load the cometkins-style sprite for Elderwood if [Better Resources](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/6942) is installed.

## 2.0.5 <sup><sub><sup>[ðŸ”¼ Back to top](#wpnz-change-log)</sup></sub></sup>

### Fixed

* Prevented an exception thrown when drawing the tooltip of weapons with bonus defense if CMBT's Defense Overhaul is disabled.
* Fixed a small display issue when drawing the tooltip of weapons with negative defense.
* Galaxy and Infinity sword types should now obey the config settings.

## 2.0.0 <sup><sub><sup>[ðŸ”¼ Back to top](#wpnz-change-log)</sup></sub></sup>

* Initial release of Weapons module.

### Changed

* Reduced the minimum mine level required for new weapons to appear at Marlon's shop. The first batch of weapons will now be available instantly. The second will appear as soon as level 15. Some prices have also been lowered.
* Mine chests no longer drop seeds. Can now drop fertilizers. Increased the stack of several chest rewards. Improved the odds of hitting the jackpot (Quality Sprinklers).
* Increased the spawn chance of breakable containers in the mines. Implemented a handicap system to dynamically increase the chance of obtaining special items from breakable containers (including weapons).
* Implemented a handicap system to dynamically increase the chance of encountering monsters with special item drops. Weapons dropped from monsters are still rarer and stronger on average than those dropped by containers.
* The base knocback of swords and daggers has been cut in half.
* Some weapons' stats have been changed, including the Galaxy and Infinity weapons which received significant buffs.
* Weapon revalidation now occurs automatically upon first initialization of the module. Manually executing the `revalidate` command is no longer necessary. However, you **must** manually disable Arsenal module before uninstalling MARGO.

### Fixed

* The Dawn Blade will no longer be dismantled as long as it has forges to be removed.
* Generosity Trial now only checks for completion on the Master player, to avoid issues in multiplayer games.
* The description of the Jinxed debuff should now properly reflect the changes made by the Overhauled Defense setting.
* Fixed some typos causing Aquamarine, Jade and Emerald-resonances to not apply correctly to their correspondingly-forged weapons.
* Generosity Trial completion should now register on all farmhands.
* I'm not sure why, but Slick Moves now also works in the direction of movement.
