## Minor Release 2.5.0 Highlights <sup><sub><sup>[ðŸ”¼](#margo-change-logs)</sup></sub></sup>

* [PNDS]: Mr. and Ms. Angler can now mate when placed together in a pond.
* [PROFS]: Major overhaul of Fishing professions. Please see the dedicated [changelog](Modules/Professions/CHANGELOG.md).
* [PROFS]: Prospector Hunt streak now also buffs the chance of spawning panning points.
* [PROFS]: Slingshot projectiles now leave a trail effect when overcharged.
* [PROFS]: SpaceCore skill prestige choices can now also be respecced at the Statue of Prestige (untested).
* [SLNGS]: Removed gemstone enchantments and replaced with gemstones as ammo. Major new Archery compatibility changes, including a new Misc. download for compatibility with [Archery Starter Pack](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/16768).
* [SLNGS]: Ranged weapons now display the equipped ammo (can be disabled).
* [TXS]: Now persists data in the Mod Data Dictionary, which fixes a possible issue if the player reset the game after saving on the night of the 1st, but before completing the 2nd.
* [TOLS]: Added Radioactive tool upgrades and Volcano Forge Upgrading. Please see the dedicated [changelog](Modules/Tools/CHANGELOG.md).
* [TOLS]: Added option to reward experience for using the Watering Can, and another to prevent refilling the Watering Can with salt water.**

** Yes, I know these already exist in other mods. But I prefer to avoid downloading small immersion tweaks when they can be added directly to the modular overhaul.

## Major Release 2.0.0 Highlights <sup><sub><sup>[ðŸ”¼](#margo-change-logs)</sup></sub></sup>
