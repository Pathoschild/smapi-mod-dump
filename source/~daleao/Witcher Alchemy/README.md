Long ago, the land was overrun with monsters. In these dark times, a group of monster slayers sought the wisdom of alchemists, in hopes of gaining an edge in battle. The alchemists taught the monster m the nature of substances , a group of monster hunters There are tales whispred between adventurer's of a once mutated breed of human monster slayers, who used their deep knowledge of alchemy to develop powerful magical mixtures to gain superhuman abilities.


## Mixtures & Primary Substances

An item may be used as an alchemy ingredient if it contains one of six primary substances:

 * ![](./resources/Substances/Substances_Small_Aether.png) Aether (Ae)
 * ![](./resources/Substances/Substances_Small_Hydragenum.png) Hydragenum (Hg)
 * ![](./resources/Substances/Substances_Small_Quebrith.png) Quebrith (Qb)
 * ![](./resources/Substances/Substances_Small_Rebis.png) Rebis (Rb)
 * ![](./resources/Substances/Substances_Small_Vermilion.png) Vermilion (Vm)
 * ![](./resources/Substances/Substances_Small_Vitriol.png) Vitriol (Vt)

These substances can be found in varying concentrations across different items; from foragable goods and flowers, to minerals and even monster parts. Any given item may contain exactly one or none of these substances.

When combined in a medium, referred to as a **base**, these substances react to produce different types of **mixtures**. There are three mixture types, each corresponding to a type of base:
- **Potions** are mixtures created in a distilled alcohol base. These can be dangerously toxic if imbued, but also can grant powerful magical effects to the imbuer.
- **Weapon Oils** are mixtures created using greases, such as butter or vegetable oils. They can be applied to weapons in order to exploit vulnerabilities in a monster's physiology.
- **Bombs** are mixtures created using ignitable powders such as coal. Inspired by the explosives employed by miners, these bombs house violent alchemical reactions that can rain life as well as destruction.

The exact product of a reaction is determined not by the specific ingredients used, but by **the proportions of primary substances** contained within the chosen ingredients. In other words, there are no set recipes for alchemical mixtures; instead they can be made through many combination of ingredients, so long as the concentrations of each of the primary substances respects a particular formula.


## Formulae & Experimentation

Most alchemical formulae can be learned from scrolls found throughout the world. Others are learned by word of mouth. Yet a few can only be learned by **experimentation**. As the word implies, this is done by mixing random ingredients in an attempt to create something new. The result will always be an unknown potion, oil or bomb, which must first be tested. If the chosen ingredient combination produces a stable reaction, the formula will then be learned, added to your grimoire, from which point it can be accessed at any time to recreate the mixture just like any ordinarily learned formula. However, if the reaction is unstable then the experiment could prove disastrous!

**All formulae can be learned by experimentation**, which means that all mixtures are immediately available, limited only by your ingredients and Cauldron.


## The Cauldron

The Cauldron is the Alchemist's tool. Forged especially to resist corrosion and trap poisonous fumes, the Cauldron is paramount for safe alchemical practice. In addition, it can be coated with purifying metals like copper, iron and gold, to reduce the toxicity of resulting mixtures. Upgrading your Cauldron will also increase it's ingredient capacity, allowing you to try on more complex reactions.

To begin mixing ingredients all you have to do is approach a heat source, like a fireplace or campfire, with your trusty Cauldron in hand.


## Toxicity

Dangerously toxic substances, all potions, as well as some bombs, incur an associated toxicity cost. In order to benefit from their effects, the alchemist must learn to manage the amount of toxins in their body so as to prevent an overdose. Managing toxicity will require careful attention to the toxicity bar, which will appear next to your health indicated by a skull icon. This bar represents your toxicity tolerance, and it fills green with each potion imbued or when exposed to the toxins released by certain bombs. Toxicity cost is split between **active toxicity**, represented in bright green, and **dormant toxicity**, represented in dark green.

For potions, 75% of the associated toxicity cost is added as active toxicity, which lasts for twice the potion's duration, while the remaining 25% is added as dormant toxicity, and can easily remain in your system for several days. As many potions can be simultaneously imbued as allowed by your toxicity tolerance. However, each active potion effect will increase the toxicity cost of the next, exacerbating the danger of imbuing multiple potions.

For bombs, the inhaled fumes are much harder for the body to metabolize. As a result, 100% of the associated toxicity cost is added as dormant toxicity, but only if you are hit by the explosion. Certain bombs with lingering effects will also gradually build active toxicity as you stand in the afflicted area.
 
Excessive toxicity adversely affects your abilities, and may even lead to your demise. Past a certain threshold, you will begin to overdose and lose health over time. You also become increasingly prone to episodes of **Toxic Fever**, which impairs movement at a regular pace. If your toxicity reaches 100% you will pass out on the spot, ending up in a coma that may last for several days.

Toxicity gradually recovers over time, or can otherwise be purged with **White Honey**. Your toxicity tolerance will naturally build with exposure to the toxins, along with your alchemy proficiency.


## Secondary Substances

There are three additional, or secondary, substances:

* ![](./resources/Substances/Substances_Small_Albedo.webp) Albedo,
* ![](./resources/Substances/Substances_Small_Nigredo.webp) Nigredo, and
* ![](./resources/Substances/Substances_Small_Rubedo.webp) Rubedoï»¿.

A given ingredient may contain exactly one of these substances, or it may contain none. If, while brewing a potion (and only a potion), all the chosen ingredients contain the same secondary substance, then the resulting potion will gain an extra effect:
 - **Albedo dominance:** reduces the potion's own toxicity and that of all subsequent potions consumed during the next in-game hour by 20%.
 - **Nigredo dominance:** increases all damage inflicted for the next 4 in-game hours by 20%.
 - **Rubedo dominance:** recovers 0.3% of max health and energy every second for the next 4 in-game hours.


## Skill Perks

As a widely misunderstood and since forgotten science, there are no known professions which specialize in the field of Alchemy. Unlike other skills, progression in Alchemy is offered through a much more flexible tree composed of 16 perks, split across 4 schools of alchemy craft with 4 perks each. Upon leveling your Alchemy proficiency you are awarded one perk point to spend on any of these 4 schools. Higher-tiered perks require at least one perk to be unlocked from the previous tier, not necessarily pertaining to the same school; perks from different schools can be mixed and matched freely.
