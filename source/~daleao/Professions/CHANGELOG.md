## 0.2.9

### Added

* Mastered skills now display a gold icon in the Skills Page menu. Thanks to [silicon](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/siliconmodding/about-me?gameId=1303) and [KawaiiMuski](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/KawaiiMuski/about-me) for the icons.

<sup><sup>[ðŸ”¼ Back to top](#professions-changelog)</sup></sup>

## 0.1.0 - Alpha release for 1.6

### Changed

* Prestige levels no longer require having all professions in the skill. It is now a reward for Mastering each individual skill. The Statue of Prestige has been renamed to Statue of Transcendence to avoid confusion. 
* Skill reset feature is unchanged. But note that choosing to Master a skill will prevent it from being reset further, effectively locking you out of any unobtained profession. *This may change in the future, but for now you have been warned.*
* Similarly, the Limit Break is now a reward for Mastering the Combat skill.
* All prestiged profession variants, and a few base variants, have been reworked. Prestige professions are now much more impactful end-game rewards. Please review the section [Professions](README.md#professions) of the README to learn more.
* Treasure Hunts are now triggered on Time Change instead of Player Warped. The chance to start a Treasure Hunt now depends on how far you have traveled or how many rocks you have broken since the previous hunt.
* Misc. code improvements.

### Removed

* Removed custom support for Luck skill and Love of Cooking.
* Removed alost all third-party mod integrations since I don't know which of them were/will be updated. I might re-add Automate integration later, or I might not.
