# PROFESSIONS Changelog

## 0.4.0

Updated for DaLionheart 1.3.0.

### Changed

* Tweaked tracking arrow colors a bit. Artifacts spots are now always tracked with green, and are the only thing tracked with that color. Prospector mining nodes is now a darker orange for better contrast with Scavenger forage.
* Default tracking arrow size was reduced to x1 (default vanilla size), down from x1.2.

### Removed

* Removed FakeFarmer (moved to Core mod).

<sup><sup>[🔼 Back to top](#professions-changelog)</sup></sup>

* Players can no longer enter the Mastery Cave if one ore more vanilla skills are not at level 10 or above.

## 0.3.4

<sup><sup>[🔼 Back to top](#professions-changelog)</sup></sup>

## 0.3.3

### Fixed

* Fixed possible issue in LevelUpMenu code.
* Added missing translation keys. Updated Chinese translation, thanks to Awassakura.

<sup><sup>[🔼 Back to top](#professions-changelog)</sup></sup>

## 0.3.2

### Fixed

* Add/remove Mastery commands now also correctly changes Mastery level.
    * You can either use `prfs set <skill> <mastered/unmastered>` to add or remove a mastery, **OR** you can use `prfs add mastery <skill>` / `prfs remove mastery <skill>`. Both commands do the same thing, except that `add` and `remove` commands can accept the parameter `all` instead of a skill name to process all 5 skills at once. Obviously do not use `<>` when actually running these commands.

<sup><sup>[🔼 Back to top](#professions-changelog)</sup></sup>

## 0.3.1

### Added

* All shaken fruits are now considered forage for the purpose of Ecologist perks.
* Added a warning dialogue before claiming a skill Mastery to inform players that skill resetting will become unavailable. No excuses now.
* Added back UiInfoSuite2 compatibility.

### Changed

* Angler bonus increased from 0.5% to 1% per unique max-size fish, and from 2% to 5% per Legendary fish.
* Can no longer enter the Mastery Cave unless all skills are level 10 (vanilla behavior). Otherwise this would allow players to claim Mastery of skills at any level, unless I messed around with vanilla code even more, which just isn't worth it.
* Skill Reset stars will no longer appear until the player has 2 or more professions in any skill. This is to avoid players getting stuck looking at bronze stars if they don't plan on resetting any time soon.

### Fixed

* Fixed Farmhands not being able to complete Scavenger Hunts.
* Fixed Delight and Shiny Mayo still being present in the game when disabled.
* Trash fished out of Fish Ponds no longer counts towards Conservationist perks.
* Fixed a possible issue in Tree.shake patcher.
* Updated incorrect description in README for Ecologist profession which stated that it affects Mushroom Boxes. It doesn't.

* Added console command to set/unset mastered skills.
* Added compatibility for new [Enchantments](../Enchantments) mod.
* Fish Smoker no longer mentions that it preserves quality, since it doesn't with this mod.

### Changed

    * **Yellow:** Foraging stuff (Scavenger)
    * **Orange:** Mining stuff (Prospector)
    * **Blue:** Panning spots (Prospector), ladders/shafts (Prospector), artifact spots (both)

* Spelunker buff is now a stackable buff.
* Massive performance improvement (7x) in enemy AI code ~~by undoing a stupid "optimization" I had done a while back~~.

### Fixed

* Hopefully fixed possible issue caused bad badly-coded fish mods that don't properly assign context tags to their fish.
* Fixed Ostrich and Golden Mayo items not being produced correctly.

<sup><sup>[🔼 Back to top](#professions-changelog)</sup></sup>

## 0.1.0 - Alpha release for 1.6

### Changed

* Prestige levels no longer require having all professions in the skill. It is now a reward for Mastering each individual skill. The Statue of Prestige has been renamed to Statue of Transcendence to avoid confusion. 
* Skill reset feature is unchanged. But note that choosing to Master a skill will prevent it from being reset further, effectively locking you out of any unobtained profession. *This may change in the future, but for now you have been warned.*
* Similarly, the Limit Break is now a reward for Mastering the Combat skill.
* All prestiged profession variants, and a few base variants, have been reworked. Prestige professions are now much more impactful end-game rewards. Please review the section [Professions](README.md#professions) of the README to learn more.
* Treasure Hunts are now triggered on Time Change instead of Player Warped. The chance to start a Treasure Hunt now depends on how far you have traveled or how many rocks you have broken since the previous hunt.
* Misc. code improvements.

### Removed

* Removed custom support for Luck skill and Love of Cooking.
* Removed alost all third-party mod integrations since I don't know which of them were/will be updated. I might re-add Automate integration later, or I might not.
