## Description


## Config

config.json is available to edit and configure the Mods functions.
 After the first time the Mod is started it will create a default config.json file in the Mod folder.
 config.json is a simple text file and easy to edit. It might be hard to find the Mods folder for some.

The mod also supports the Generic Mod Config Menu (GMCM) interface.
GMCM is a much easier way to configure the Longer Fence Life mod.
GMCM provides a graphical user interface to configure the Mod settings.
You can configure from the game title screen and/or during the game.
GMCM is available at https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5098
The NexusMods page shows the locations of the GMCM config button(s).
