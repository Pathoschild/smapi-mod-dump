## LevelExtender
[**Level Extender**](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1471) is a [Stardew Valley](http://stardewvalley.net/) mod which extends the level cap to 100.
## LE Install
1. [Install the latest version of SMAPI](https://smapi.io).
2. Install this mod from [NexusMods](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1471).
3. Run the game using SMAPI.

## LE Usage
The mod will...
* **Overhaul** the leveling system. Increasing the levels the player can reach, to 100.
* Fishing is overhauled past level 10. Levels after 10 now slow down the degradation of the reeling bar.
* Optional (false by default) monster spawning everywhere. The monster spawning is based on your combat level and has a small chance of spawning at any given game tick. These monsters are generally weaker by default, but scale based on your player's Combat level. 
* Skills have the same XP system UNTIL you reach level 10. The total XP to reach 100 is somewhere around 2,000,000 XP.
* Most skill changes past level 10 will show when you hover your mouse over a particular skill in the game menu.
* SDV has a host of features for each skill; based on skill level. It doesn't matter that the skills are over 10. For example: increased crop yield, based on Farming level.

## LE Config
A `username_(numbers).json` will appear in the mod's folder after you run the game once. It is **STRONGLY** recommended to not change anything in this file. It has a very high chance of causing corruption with the mod files. 

## LE Compatibility
* Works with Stardew Valley 1.3
* Works in single-player and multiplayer.
* Works with [Extreme Fishing Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2212), and is recommened to be used with [Extreme Fishing Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1471) for a better experience with the game. 

## LE Versions

### 1.3.11
* Initial release.
