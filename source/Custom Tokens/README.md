Custom Tokens is a mod that provides some basic additional tokens for Content Patcher, extending what can be done

### Custom Tokens registers the following tokens:
- MineLevel the player is currently on
- VolcanoFloor the player is currently on
- DeepestMineLevel, the deepest minelevel the player has reached
- Anniversary of the player, split into two tokens, AnniversaryDay and AnniversarySeason
- YearsMarried, total number of years married
- QuestIDsCompleted, a list of quest ids that the player has completed
- QuestsCompleted, the total number of quests completed
- SOIDsCompleted, a list of the special orders a player has completed. See Special Order data for how to interpret return values
- SOCompleted, total number of different special orders completed
- DeathCount, total number of times the player has died
- DeathCountMarried, an extension of DeathCount that tracks how many times a player has died after being married.
- DeathCountPK, (provides a more accurate value than the DeathCount token for use in the PlayerKilled event)
- DeathCountMarriedPK, an extension of DeathCountPK that tracks how many times a player has died after being married.
- PassOutCount, how many times a player has passed out.

### Using Custom Tokens:
- SMAPI must be installed
- Ensure Custom Tokens is listed as a dependency in your content pack
- Tokens used must be prefixed with the mod's unique ID e.g TheMightyAmondee.CustomTokens/MineLevel
- Many tokens require an update rate faster than CP's default as they can change throughout the day

### Limitations:
Previous quest determination was removed in version 1.4.0 due to issues (unreliable, buggy and incorrectly added cancelled quests as complete). Therefore, only newly completed quests are recorded in the token. Version 1.4.0 uses Harmony for more reliable quest recording, just FYI.

Necessary token values are now stored in the save file, data files can be deleted as of version 1.4.0

The mod works best with new save files due to these limitations, while it will still work fine with old save files, some tokens will be missing values.

### Getting old save files up to speed (Version 1.3.1 and below):
Old or current save files require some additional set-up. This isn't strictly necessary but may result in incorrect token values.

A per-save JSON file will be generated after the day is started for each save so the mod can track values not tracked by the game. This is found in the data folder located in the mod folder. These values can be adjusted as needed as they will have an initial value of 0, which may not be accurate for older saves. Ensure the old tracker value is also updated to the same value as the current tracker value when changing values
 
While the mod can determine whether most quests have been completed, some quest ids from previously completed quests in old save files need to be added manually to the save's JSON file in AdditionalQuestsCompleted. Custom quest ids can also be added here. The field should look something like this "AdditionalQuestsCompleted": [6,16,128,130] depending on what quests have previously been completed.
  - If you have completed "Getting Started", add 6
  - If you have entered the Adventurer's Guild, add 16
  - If you have done secret note 25 (Abigail), add 128
  - If you have done secret note 25 (Caroline), add 129
  - If you have finished "The Pirate's Wife", add 130

  
### Config:
- AllowDebugging adds a single debug command so the values of the tokens can be viewed in the SMAPI console. When enabled typing "tracker" in the console will display a list of token values, this does not indicate whether CP has updated the token to this value. Use patch summary for that.
- ResetDeathCountMarriedWhenDivorced will cause the DeathCountMarried token to reset to 0 when divorced, default is true.

### Tokens in more detail:
Token | Default value | What it tracks | Notes 
----- | ------------- | -------------- | ------
Minelevel | 0 | Players current minelevel | Add 120 to Skull Cavern floors for token value. The quarry mine has a minelevel of 77377
VolcanoFloor | 0 | Players current floor in the Volcano Dungeon
DeepestMineLevel | 0 | The deepest minelevel the player has reached | Skull Cavern floors included
AnniversaryDay | 0 | The day the player was married on
AnniversarySeason | No season | The season the player was married in | Value is in all lower-case
Years Married | 0 | The number of years the player has been married for
QuestIDsCompleted | None | A list of quest ids that the player has completed | Only records quests with ids as specified in the Quests.xnb
QuestsCompleted | 0 | The total number of quests completed | Includes quests with no ids e.g Bulletin board quests
SOIDsCompleted | None | A list of the special orders a player has completed | Repeating the same order will not add the key to the token again 
SOCompleted | 0 | Total number of different special orders completed | Only tracks different orders, won't include repeated orders
DeathCount | 0 | The number of deaths
DeathCountPK | 0 | Value is DeathCount + 1 when save is loaded |Because there are limits on the update rate of tokens in CP, this token can be used as a more accurate snapshot of DeathCount in some cases, mainly the PlayerKilled event
DeathCountMarried | 0 | The number of deaths that occur when the player is married
DeathCountMarriedPK | 0 | Value is DeathCountMarried + 1 when married | Because there are limits on the update rate of tokens in CP, this token can be used as a more accurate snapshot of DeathCountMarried in some cases, mainly the PlayerKilled event
PassOutCount | 0 | The number of times the player has passed out, either from exhaustion or it reaching 2AM

### Special Order data
Since Special Orders don't have a number id like quests they are recorded in the save file using a unique string as shown in the table below. The mod will return this unique string as an ID for each Special Order completed in the SOKeysCompleted token
