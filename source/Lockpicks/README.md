#### **Lockpicks** lets you attempt to pick your way through locked doors. It will allow you to access locations early, referring to both time of day, and progression-wise. (As such, it could be considered somewhat unbalanced.) Curious? Missing your favorite NPC? Or just want to buy some seeds on a Wednesday? This could be the mod for you!

# Features

* Multiplayer Compatible!
* Multi-lingual! It should support every language the game supports. Uses some machine translations (for now), if you have a correction or suggestion please post it and I'll get it merged in.
* Lockpicks work on most bedroom doors, exterior doors, and even a few special doors (like the sewer grate).
* Once a lock is picked, it will remain unlocked for all players for the rest of the day.
* Lockpicks have a very small chance of breaking on use.
