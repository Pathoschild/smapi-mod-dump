# Grandfather's Gift REMADE

This mod is directly inspired by [Grandfather's Gift 1.0 on NexusMods](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/985), but since that mod is not open source, I have to totally remake it from scratch.

Only the ideas remain; the code, the logic, even the words, everything came from my diabolical mind (with great help from my friends at [The Stardew Valley Forums](https://community.playstarbound.com/forums/mods.215/)).

This mod has been released [**on NexusMods**](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/4151)

## Configuration

I put in some `config.json` knobs to fine tune the experience:

| Knob        | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
|`traceLogging` | Set to `false` if you think the TRACE logging is too chatty, making it difficult to troubleshoot other mods |
|`triggerDay`   | The day when the mod will trigger. Limited to `2<=day<=28`. Season & year are locked to "spring" and 1, respectively |
|`weaponStats`  | You can modify the Elf Dagger stats here. Won't affect other weapons and/or events because, by default, you can NOT get the Elf Dagger |
