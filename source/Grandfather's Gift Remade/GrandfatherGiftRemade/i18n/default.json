  "letter": "Dear @,^^    Stardew Valley wasn't a peaceful place when I started the farm. Yet I persevered, made friends, and had a ... relationship with an Elf princess. But alas, our differences meant that we were not meant to be together.^^   Nevertheless, as we said our goodbyes, she gave me this dagger that you have discovered, as a token to remember her by.^^    May this dagger serves you -- and your future family -- as well as it had served me, and mine.^^Love,^Grandpa.^"
