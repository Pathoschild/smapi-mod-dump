# Installation
## Nexus Mods (Recommended)
All (or most) of my mods are available to download on [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley). Each mod page has its own installation instructions. Downloading from there also supports me as each unique mod download gives the author donation points (unless the author has disabled receiving donation points).

## GitHub
You can download my mods here on github as well. Every mod folder in this repo should have a raw `<MOD_NAME>.zip` file for you to download (by simply clicking on the file and then `View Raw`). Additionally, you may find some mod releases on this GitHub repo's releases page.
