**All Professions** is a [Stardew Valley](http://stardewvalley.net/) mod which gives your farmer
all possible professions when you level up, instead of just the one chosen.

## Install
1. [Install the latest version of SMAPI](https://smapi.io).
2. Install [this mod from Nexus mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/174).
3. Run the game using SMAPI.

## Use
Just install the mod and play the game. When you level up, all professions will be added to your
farmer instead of just your chosen one (e.g. both Rancher and Tiller instead of just Rancher). If
your farmer already leveled up, any profession they're eligible for will be added automatically.

## Configure
The mod will work fine by default, but you can customise which professions get assigned for each
skill level by editing the `data.json` file. You generally shouldn't edit it unless you really want
to change the mod logic though. Your changes will be reset when you update the mod, so you'll need
to reapply them.

## Compatibility
* Works with Stardew Valley 1.5 on Linux/Mac/Windows.
* Works in single-player, multiplayer, and split-screen mode.
* No known mod conflicts.
