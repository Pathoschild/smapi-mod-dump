Program flow:

on last day of fall, get a list of all hoe dirt objects in the game, save it
on first day of winter, replace the list
	--won't work, would have to do for every winter day, crops wouldn't grow in winter
	
on last day of fall, set all crops.rowInSpriteSheet to 23, which is the row for wild crops
	--drawback:  would all look like wild crops when displayed
		--would have to be very careful about switching back any time the player would be looking
		--can i get player location while he is in the farm house and set it back if near the door?
		--if we go by location, when you wake up you're still by the bed, and you don't want to fire it again.  add a tag on the daychanged code to fire it only when near bed on same day, not new day
	--drawback:  planted wild seeds are designed to sprout into random wild plants (line 355 crop.cs)
		--would have to make second condition of 3 true for seeds to sprout normally, probably advance crops one day for free
		--could remember which crops had that done and set them back a day later
		
Add seeds to seed shop inventory.  See SeedShop.cs line 155, shopStock().
