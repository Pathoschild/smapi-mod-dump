Some UI code was derived from the following mods

* [Chests Anywhere](https://github.com/Pathoschild/StardewMods/tree/develop/ChestsAnywhere) for the implementation of overlays.
* [CJB Item Spawner](https://github.com/CJBok/SDV-Mods/tree/master/CJBItemSpawner) as a reference for up/down arrows and scrolling.

The implementation of carrying chests was derived from [Carry Chest](https://github.com/spacechase0/CarryChest).
