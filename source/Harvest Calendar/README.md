# HarvestCalendar

##### FEATURES / HOW TO USE
This mod simply calculate the day when you can harvest your crops, and put an icon on the day on the calendar.  
The crop with largest amount would be chosen as the icon shown on the calendar.  
Fruit trees, Tea trees and crops planted in a pot would be ignored.  
Works with crops that regrows.  
Just buy a calendar from Robin so you can check it at home. Or use Mobile Phone + Mobile Calendar or other mods that gives access to the calendar anywhere.  
To use the blacklist, move mouse to hover on a crop on the ground, press BlacklistTheCropKeybind(default: Alt+G) to blacklist it  
Press ToggleBlacklistKeybind(default: Alt+H) to open the blacklist.  
Crops in blacklist won't be count by this mod, you can blacklist certain crops so that the calendar won't have too much icons on it, such as Hops as it regrows everyday.  
When the Calendar is open, select a day and press ToggleCalendarDayDetailKeybind(default: mouse left click / Controller A button) to open up the detail menu which gives more detail about the harvestable.

##### KNOWN ISSUES
Should works with other mods.  
Not work with mod that give access to calendar page of other seasons or change the length of a month.  
Not sure whether supports multiplayer or not.  
Let me know if there are any other issues by posting a comment or bug report.
