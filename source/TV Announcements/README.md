TVAnnouncements
==============
This is a Stardew Valley SMAPI mod which displays a notification when you wake up telling you what the Fortune Teller and Weather Report says, as well as if the Queen of Sauce is on today.

All 3 notifications can be configured to be turned on/off.

See this mod on the Nexus mods [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/3649) or on GitHub [here](https://github.com/Zyin055/TVAnnouncements/).
